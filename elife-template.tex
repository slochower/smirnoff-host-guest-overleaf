\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Host-guest systems}

In this manuscript, we report the binding thermodynamics for 43 host-guest complexes which were experimentally characterized in \cite{rekharsky_thermodynamic_1997} and previously studied in \cite{henriksen_evaluating_2017}. The host molecules are $\alpha$- or $\beta$-cyclodextrin with guests that can be characterized by their functional group as either ammonium, carboxylate, or cyclic alcohol.

\subsection{Force field parameters}
Host-guest systems were parameterized with 



GAFF v1.7 from Niel
GAFF v2.1 from AMBER18.


A single glucose molecule with methoxy caps on the O1 and O4 alcohols... AM1-BCC partial charges and GAFF v.17 Lennard-Jones and valence parameters.

GAFF v2.1 

\subsection{Simulations}
GAFF v1.7 simulations were performed with AMBER16; GAFF v2.1 and SMIRNOFF99Frosst simulations were performed with AMBER18 molecular dynamics software.
\subsection{Thermodynamic calculations}
We used the attach-pull-release (APR) method as implemented in the open source package pAPRika, version 0.0.3.

A complete description of the APR method is described in \cite{henriksen_computational_2015}.

\section{Results}
SMIRNOFF99Frosst does as well as GAFF, despite far fewer numerical force field parameters.
