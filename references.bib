Ambiguity in molecular models often stems from the dissemination of molecular
force fields in a format that is not directly usable or is ambiguously
documented via a non-machine readable mechanism. Specifically, the lack of a
general tool for performing automated atom-typing under the rules of a
particular force field facilitates errors in model parameterization that may go
unnoticed if other researchers are unable reproduce this process. Here, we
present Foyer, a Python tool that enables users to define force field
atom-typing rules in a format that is both machine- and human-readable thus
eliminating ambiguity in atom-typing and additionally providing a framework for
force field dissemination. Foyer defines force fields in an XML format, where
SMARTS strings are used to define the chemical context of a particular atom
type. Herein we describe the underlying methodology of the Foyer package,
highlighting its advantages over typical atom-typing approaches and demonstrate
is application in several use-cases.},

	abstract = {Herein, we present a novel Hamiltonian replica exchange protocol for classical molecular dynamics simulations of protein folding/unfolding. The scheme starts from the analysis of the energy-networks responsible for the stabilization of the folded conformation, by means of the energy-decomposition approach. In this framework, the compact energetic map of the native state is generated by a preliminary short molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the protein in explicit solvent. This map is simplified by means of an eigenvalue decomposition. The highest components of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue indicate which sites, named “hot spots”, are likely to be responsible for the stability and correct folding of the protein. In the Hamiltonian replica exchange protocol, we use modified force-field parameters to treat the interparticle non-bonded potentials of the hot spots within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to all other residues, as well as solvent-solvent interactions. We show that it is possible to reversibly simulate the folding/unfolding behavior of two test proteins, namely Villin HeadPiece HP35 (35 residues) and Protein A (62 residues), using a limited number of replicas. We next discuss possible implications for the study of folding mechanisms via all atom simulations.},

The intermolecular distance between the O and H in the water molecule was found to decrease upon the encapsulation of water molecules inside the cavity, indicating the increase in the stability of water clusters. The computed binding energies were found to be sensitive to the choice of functional. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) shows that the repulsive Pauli interaction decides the stability of the water complex. In all the encapsulated systems, except the eight water clusters, the electrostatic interactions have supremacy over the dispersive term, due to the large polarization induced by the water clusters. Molecular electrostatic potentials of entrapped systems show the charge distribution between CB7 and water clusters. QTAIM analysis indicates the existence of noncovalent intramolecular interactions between CB7 and water clusters and ellipticity values to be least for 8H2O@CB7. The topological of ρ(r) fields at the urido nitrogen plane in CB7, proves the stronger bonding with water molecules. Thus, entrapped water molecules are not electronically innocent inside the cage and have noncovalent interaction with hydrophobic part of CB7 molecule. Atom centered Density Matrix Propagation (ADMP) molecular dynamic studies shows that the water clusters are stable with respect to their isolated cluster geometry, inside the cucurbituril and the change in potential energy surface is due to the distortion in the geometry of the CB7 unit.},

	abstract = {The end-point methods like MM/PBSA or MM/GBSA estimate the free energy of a biomolecule by combining its molecular mechanics energy with solvation free energy and entropy terms. Their performance largely depends on the particular system of interest and despite numerous attempts to improve their reliability that have resulted in many variants, there is still no clear alternative to improve their accuracy. On the other hand, the relatively small cyclodextrin host-guest complexes, for which high quality binding calorimetric data are usually available, are becoming reference models for testing the accuracy of free energy methods. In this work, we further assess the performance of various MM/PBSA-like approaches as applied to cyclodextrin complexes. To this end, we select a set of complexes between β-CD and 57 small organic molecules that has been previously studied with the binding energy distribution analysis method in combination with an implicit solvent model (JCTC, 2013, 9, 3136). For each complex, a conventional 1.0 s MD simulation in explicit solvent is carried out. Then we employ semiempirical quantum chemical calculations, several variants of the MM-PB(GB)SA methods, entropy estimations, etc., in order to assess the reliability of the end-point affinity calculations. The best end-point protocol in this study, which combines DFTB3 energies with entropy corrections, yields estimations of the binding free energies that still have substantial errors (RMSE=2.2 kcal/mol), but exhibits a good prediction capacity in terms of ligand ranking (R2=0.66) that is close or even better than that of rigorous free energy methodologies. Our results can be helpful to discriminate between the intrinsic limitations of the end-point methods and other sources of error, such as the underlying energy and continuum solvation methods.},

	abstract = {The plasma membrane of the cell is a complex, tightly regulated, heterogeneous environment shaped by proteins, lipids, and small molecules. Ca2+ ions are important cellular messengers, spatially separated from anionic lipids. After cell injury, disease, or apoptotic events, anionic lipids are externalized to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and encounter Ca2+, resulting in dramatic changes in the plasma membrane structure and initiation of signaling cascades. Despite the high chemical and biological significance, the structures of lipid–Ca2+ nanoclusters are still not known. Previously, we demonstrated by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy that upon binding to Ca2+, individual phosphatidylserine lipids populate two distinct yet-to-be-characterized structural environments. Here, we concurrently employ extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with our accelerated membrane mimetic and detailed NMR measurements to identify lipid–Ca2+ nanocluster conformations. We find that major structural characteristics of these nanoclusters, including interlipid pair distances and chemical shifts, agree with observable NMR parameters. Simulations reveal that lipid–ion nanoclusters are shaped by two characteristic, long-lived lipid structures induced by divalent Ca2+. Using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations of chemical shifts on MD-captured lipid–ion complexes, we show that computationally observed conformations are validated by experimental NMR data. Both NMR measurements of diluted specifically labeled lipids and MD simulations reveal that the basic structural unit that reshapes the membrane is a Ca2+-coordinated phosphatidylserine tetramer. Our combined computational and experimental approach presented here can be applied to other complex systems in which charged membrane-active molecular agents leave structural signatures on lipids.},

The values of thermodynamic quantities, in particular the standard molar Gibbs energy, correlate well with the structural features in the ligands. These structural correlations can be used for the estimation of thermodynamic quantities for related reactions. Enthalpy−entropy compensation is evident when the individual classes of substances studied herein are considered, but does not hold when these various classes of ligands are considered collectively. The NMR results indicate that the mode of accommodation of the acids and amines in the α-cyclodextrin cavity is very similar, but that the 1-methyl groups in 1-methylhexylamine and in 1-methylheptylamine and the N-methyl group in N-methylhexylamine lie outside the α-cyclodextrin cavity.

	abstract = {Vinca domain ligands are small molecules that interfere with the binding of vinblastine to tubulin and inhibit microtubule assembly. Many such compounds cause isodesmic association which results in difficulties in biochemical or structural studies of their interaction with tubulin. The complex of two tubulins with the stathmin-like domain of the RB3 protein (T(2)R) is a protofilament-like short assembly that does not assemble further. This has allowed structural studies of the binding of several vinca domain ligands by X-ray crystallography as crystals of the corresponding complexes diffract to near atomic resolution. This proved that their sites are located at the interface of two tubulin molecules arranged as in a curved protofilament. These sites overlap with that of vinblastine. Structural data are generally consistent with the results of available structure-function studies, though subtle differences exist. Binding in solution to the vinca domain displayed in T(2)R is conveniently studied by fluorescence spectroscopy or by monitoring inhibition of the T(2)R GTPase activity. In addition, inhibition of nucleotide exchange allows characterization of the binding to the vinca domain moiety displayed by the beta-subunit of an isolated tubulin molecule. T(2)R is therefore a useful tool to characterize and dissect the binding of vinca domain ligands to tubulin. In addition, these studies have provided new information on the interaction of tubulin with guanine nucleotides, namely on the mechanisms of nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis.},

Herein, we describe the molecular and structural basis by which ARQ 197 selectively targets c-Met. Through our analysis we reveal a previously undisclosed, novel inhibitory mechanism that utilizes distinct regulatory elements of the c-Met kinase. The structure of ARQ 197 in complex with the c-Met kinase domain shows that the inhibitor binds a conformation that is distinct from published kinase structures. ARQ 197 inhibits c-Met autophosphorylation and is highly selective for the inactive or unphosphorylated form of c-Met. Through our analysis of the interplay between the regulatory and catalytic residues of c-Met, and by comparison between the autoinhibited canonical conformation of c-Met bound by ARQ 197 to previously described kinase domains of type III receptor tyrosine kinases, we believe this to be the basis of a powerful new in silico approach for the design of similar inhibitors for other protein kinases of therapeutic interest.},

Here, we show that Golgi-localized gamma ear-containing Arf-binding protein 3 (GGA3) interacts selectively with the Met/hepatocyte growth factor RTK when stimulated, to sort it for recycling in association with “gyrating” clathrin. GGA3 loss abrogates Met recycling from a Rab4 endosomal subdomain, resulting in pronounced trafficking of Met toward degradation. Decreased Met recycling attenuates ERK activation and cell migration. Met recycling, sustained ERK activation, and migration require interaction of GGA3 with Arf6 and an unexpected association with the Crk adaptor. The data show that GGA3 defines an active recycling pathway and support a broader role for GGA3-mediated cargo selection in targeting receptors destined for recycling.},

UBPy (USP8) is a growth-regulated ubiquitin isopeptidase that interacts with the HRS-STAM complex. Using Cre-loxP-mediated gene targeting in mice, we show that lack of UBPy results in embryonic lethality, whereas its conditional inactivation in adults causes fatal liver failure. The defect is accompanied by a strong reduction or absence of several growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), like epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-met), and ERBB3. UBPy-deficient cells exhibit aberrantly enlarged early endosomes colocalizing with enhanced ubiquitination and have reduced levels of HRS and STAM2. Congruently immortalized cells gradually stop proliferation upon induced deletion of UBPy. These results unveil a central and nonredundant role of UBPy in growth regulation, endosomal sorting, and the control of RTKs in vivo.},

The canonical model of RTK endocytosis involves rapid internalization of an RTK activated by ligand binding at the cell surface and subsequent sorting of internalized ligand-RTK complexes to lysosomes for degradation. Activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of RTKs results in autophosphorylation, which is mechanistically coupled to the recruitment of adaptor proteins and conjugation of ubiquitin to RTKs. Ubiquitination serves to mediate interactions of RTKs with sorting machineries both at the cell surface and on endosomes. The pathways and kinetics of RTK endocytic trafficking, molecular mechanisms underlying sorting processes, and examples of deviations from the standard trafficking itinerary in the RTK family are discussed in this work.},

We show here that c-Met accumulates progressively in perinuclear compartments, which in part include the Golgi. The c-Met content in the Golgi is principally the newly synthesized precursor form and, to a lesser extent, the internalized, recycling c-Met. By following the trafficking of c-Met inside the cell using a semi-automatic procedure and using inhibition or activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and microtubule depolymerizing agents, we show that PKC positively controls the trans-cytosolic movement of c-Met along microtubules. In parallel to its traffic, internalized c-Met is progressively degraded by a proteasome-sensitive mechanism; the lysosomal pathway does not play a substantial role. Inhibition or promotion of c-Met traffic to the perinuclear compartment does not alter the kinetics of proteasome-dependent c-Met degradation. Thus susceptibility to proteasomal degradation is not a consequence of post-endocytic traffic. The data define a PKC-controlled traffic pathway for c-Met that operates independently of its degradative pathway.},

Signalling outputs and/or duration, and subsequent cellular outcome, are thought to be distinct when emanating from endosomes compared with those from the plasma membrane. Here we show, in invasive, basal-like human breast cell models, that different mechanisms are engaged by the RTK c-Met in two different endosomes to control the actin cytoskeleton via the key migratory signal output Rac1. Despite an acute activation of Rac1 from peripheral endosomes (PEs), c-Met needs to traffic to a perinuclear endosome (PNE) to sustain Rac1 signalling, trigger optimal membrane ruffling, cell migration and invasion. Unexpectedly, in the PNE but not in the PE, PI3K and the Rac-GEF Vav2 are required. Thus we describe a novel endosomal signalling mechanism whereby one signal output, Rac1, is stimulated through distinct pathways by the same RTK depending on which endosome it is localized to in the cell.},

these deuterated sites to within +/- 0.5 A in a mixed model membrane (a
1:1 molar mixture of DMPI-4P with dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine, DMPC,
in the L alpha phase, hydrated to the level of 28 water molecules per
lipid molecule). The diffracted intensities were measured at four
different D2O/H2O ratios and six orders of diffraction were obtained.
These data sets, in conjunction with computer modelling, have been used to
determine the orientation of the inositol ring of DMPI-4P, localising each
vertical H-H distance to within approximately +/- 0.03 A. The orientation
of the inositol ring is found to be one in which the C5 hydroxyl is
extended out into the aqueous medium. This is, therefore, the most
accessible site for water-borne reagents. This may be significant for the
important pathway leading from PI-4P to PI-4,5P2. On the assumption that
the P/ODAG bond is orientated parallel to the bilayer normal, these
results are consistent with two possible conformations for the portion of
the headgroup connecting the diacylglycerol to the inositol ring.
Distinction between these two is difficult, but one may be favoured since
the other involves close atom-atom contacts.},

vesicles, and the conductance of planar bilayer membranes to study the
binding of spermine and gentamicin to membranes. Spermine and gentamicin
do not bind significantly to the zwitterionic lipid phosphatidylcholine.
We measured the concentrations of gentamicin and spermine that reverse the
charge on vesicles formed from a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and either
phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol. From these measurements, we
determined that the intrinsic association constants of the cations with
these negative lipids are all about 10 M-1. This value is orders of
magnitude lower than the apparent binding constants reported in the
literature by other groups because the negative electrostatic surface
potential of the membranes and the resultant accumulation of these cations
in the aqueous diffuse double layer adjacent to the membranes have not
been explicitly considered in previous studies. Our main conclusion is
that the Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory of the aqueous diffuse double layer can
describe surprisingly well the interaction of gentamicin and spermine with
bilayer membranes formed in a 0.1 M NaCl solution if the negative
phospholipids constitute less than 50\% of the membrane. Thus, the theory
should be useful for describing the interactions of these cations with the
bilayer component of biological membranes, which typically contain less
than 50\% negative lipids. For example, our results support the suggestion
of Sastrasinh et al. [Sastrasinh, M., Krauss, T. C., Weinberg, J. M., \&
Humes, H. D. (1982) J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 222, 350-358] that

molecules were aggregated to form the solid patches but some remained
dissolved in the fluid PC matrix. The fluid PS fraction was larger for the

to induce vesicle membrane fusion, was the same (approx. 8 dyn/cm) for all
divalent ions used. From these experimental data and theory concerning ion
binding to the membrane, it is deduced that the main cause of divalent
cation-induced membrane fusion of phosphatidylserine membranes is the
degree of increased hydrophobicity (surface tension increase) of the
membrane surface, which results from the binding of cations to acidic
phospholipid membrane surfaces. Some discussion on the molecular mechanism
of phospholipid membrane fusion is given.},

interact with detergent when analysed by charge shift electrophoresis,
indicating that they have amphipathic properties and may be able to
interact directly with the plasma membrane. We demonstrate here that
isolated profilin, as well as the profilactin complex, interacts with
anionic phospholipids. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
(PtdIns(4,5)P2) was found to be the most active phospholipid, causing a
rapid and efficient dissociation of profilactin with a concomitant
polymerization of the actin in appropriate conditions. These and other
observations suggest the possibility of a relationship between the
induction of actin filament formation and the increased activity in the
phosphatidylinositol cycle seen as a result of ligand-receptor

measuring the effect of pH on the chemical shifts of the 31P NMR signals
from the two monoester phosphate groups of PIP2. We studied the binding of
potassium, calcium, magnesium, spermine, and gentamicin ions to the
phosphoinositides by measuring the effect of these cations on the
electrophoretic mobility of multilamellar vesicles formed from mixtures of
phosphatidylcholine (PC) and either phosphatidylinositol,
phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, or PIP2; the adsorption of these cations
depends on the surface potential of the membrane and can be described
qualitatively by combining the Gouy-Chapman theory with Langmuir
adsorption isotherms. Monovalent anionic phospholipids, such as
phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol, produce a negative
electrostatic potential at the cytoplasmic surface of plasma membranes of
erythrocytes, platelets, and other cells. When the electrostatic potential
at the surface of a PC/PIP2 bilayer membrane is -30 mV and the aqueous
phase contains 0.1 M KCl at pH 7.0, PIP2 binds about one hydrogen and one
potassium ion and has a net charge of about -3. Our mobility, surface
potential, and electrode measurements suggest that a negligible fraction
of the PIP2 molecules in a cell bind calcium ions, but a significant
fraction may bind magnesium and spermine ions.},

	url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3730351},
	abstract = {The interaction of spermine with acidic phospholipids was investigated for
its possible relevance to membrane fusion. Equilibrium dialysis was used
to measure the binding of spermine and calcium to large unilamellar
vesicles (liposomes) of phosphatidate (PA) or phosphatidylserine (PS).
Spermine bound to isolated PA and PS liposomes with intrinsic association
constants of approximately 2 and 0.2 M-1, respectively. Above the
aggregation threshold of the liposomes, the binding of spermine increased
dramatically, especially for PA. The increased binding upon aggregation of
PA liposomes was interpreted as evidence for the formation of a new
binding complex after aggregation. Spermine enhanced calcium binding to
PA, while it inhibited calcium binding to PS, under the same conditions.
This difference explained the small effect of spermine on the overall rate
of calcium-induced fusion of PS liposomes as opposed to the large effect
on PA liposomes. The rate increase could be modeled by a spermine-induced
increase in the liposome aggregation rate. The preference for binding of
spermine to PA over PS suggested a preference for accessible
monoesterified phosphate groups by spermine. This preference was confirmed
by the large effects of spermine on aggregation and overall fusion rates
of liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate. The large
spermine effects on these liposomes compared with phosphatidate- or
phosphatidylinositol-containing liposomes suggested that spermine has a
strong specific interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate.
Clearly, phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol can lead to a large
change in the spermine sensitivity of membrane fusion.},

Liposome fusion was monitored by the Tb/dipicolinic acid fluorescence
assay for the intermixing of internal aqueous contents, and the release of
contents was followed by carboxyfluorescein fluorescence. Spermine and
spermidine at physiological concentrations aggregated liposomes composed
of pure phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidate (PA) and mixtures of PA
with phosphatidylcholine (PC) but did not induce any fusion. However,
liposomes composed of mixtures of acidic phospholipids, cholesterol, and a
high mole fraction of phosphatidylethanolamine could be induced to fuse by
spermine and spermidine in the absence of divalent cations. Putrescine
alone in the physiological concentration range was ineffective for both
aggregation and fusion of these liposomes. Liposomes made of pure PC did
not aggregate in the presence of polyamines. Addition of aggregating
concentrations of spermine caused a drastic increase in the rate of
Ca(2+)-induced fusion of PA liposomes and a large decrease in the
threshold Ca(2+) concentration required for fusion. This effect was less
pronounced in the case of PS or PA/PC vesicles. Preincubation of PA
vesicles with spermine before the addition of Ca(2+) resulted in a 30-fold
increase in the initial rate of fusion. We propose that polyamines may be
involved in the regulation of membrane fusion phenomena accompanying cell
growth, cell division, exocytosis, and fertilization.},

calculation of local elastic constants. The average shear and Young's
modulus of the nanocomposite are higher than those of the pure polymer for
neutral or attractive nanoparticles. For repulsive particles, these moduli
are lower. Simulation of local properties reveals that a glassy layer is
formed in the vicinity of the attractive filler, contributing to the
increased strength of the composite material. In contrast, a region of
negative moduli emerges around repulsive fillers, which provides a
mechanism for frustration relief and a lowering of the glass transition
temperature.},

monolayers formed at an air-solution interface, and the initial rate of
hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was measured after
addition of 10 microM free Ca2+. The monolayers were formed from mixtures
of phosphatidylcholine (65\% PC), phosphatidylserine (33\% PS), and
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (2\% PIP2). Increasing the surface
pressure of the monolayer, pi, from 15 to 25 mN/m decreases the rate of
hydrolysis 16-, 13-, and 5-fold for PLC-beta 1, PLC-gamma 1, and PLC-delta
1, respectively. The simplest interpretation of these results is that a
portion of each of the enzymes of area Ap must insert into the monolayer,
doing work pi Ap, prior to hydrolysis of PIP2; binding studies with simple
model compounds of known cross-sectional area are consistent with this
interpretation. Removing the monovalent acidic lipid PS from the monolayer
decreases the initial rates of hydrolysis of PIP2 about 3-fold for each
PLC isoform, which suggests that negative electrostatic surface potentials

recent renewed interest in the Hofmeister series and its molecular

be that the Hofmeister series emerges from a combination of a general
effect of cosolutes (salts, etc.) on solvent structure, and of specific
interactions between the cosolutes and the solute (protein or other
biopolymer). Hence every system needs to be studied individually in
detail, a state of affairs which is likely to continue for some time. A
deeper understanding of the Hofmeister series can be an extraordinarily
valuable guide to designing experiments, including not only those probing
the series per se, but also those designed to elucidate the adsorption,
aggregation and stabilization phenomena which underlie so many biological
events. The aim of this review is to provide an up-to-date framework to
guide such understanding, consolidating recent advances in the many fields
on which the Hofmeister series impinges.},

investigation of lipid metabolites as modulators of epidermal growth
factor (EGF) signaling pathways. We have studied epidermal growth
factor-dependent mitogenesis in BALB/c 3T3 and Syrian hamster embryo (SHE)
cells in culture. We observed that EGF stimulates the formation of
prostaglandins in BALB/c 3T3 cells and their formation appears to be
necessary for EGF dependent mitogenesis. EGF did not stimulate PGE2
formation in SHE cells and in fact, exogenously added PGE2 inhibited
mitogenesis. In both cell lines, EGF stimulated the formation of
lipoxygenase-derived 13(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and
inhibition of 13-HODE formation attenuated mitogenesis. The addition of
13-(S)-HODE enhanced EGF-dependent mitogenesis but when added alone, the
compound was not mitogenic. Other metabolites, including lipoxygenase
metabolites of arachidonic acid, were either weak simulators of
EGF-dependent mitogenesis or essentially inactive. The 13(S)-HODE appears
to be formed by an apparently unique lipoxygenase that is regulated by the
tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor. The mechanisms by which
lipids, particularly the lipoxygenase-derived linoleic acid metabolites,
modulate the EGF signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation is
discussed. The possible significance of lipoxygenase and prostaglandin H
synthase-dependent metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids in breast and
colon cancer is also discussed.},

recently studied a detergent-insoluble complex in Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) cells, following CHAPS extraction of exocytic carrier
vesicles, specifically including the apical marker protein influenza
hemagglutinin (HA). Previously, a Triton X-100 insoluble membrane residue
that was enriched in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored (GPI) proteins
and glycolipids was characterized and implicated in transport to the
apical cell surface [Brown, D., \& Rose, J. (1991) Cell 68, 533-544]. In
this report, the protein compositions of the CHAPS and Triton complexes
have been compared by two-dimensional gel analysis. Only a few major
membrane proteins are found in the complexes. The protein compositions are
qualitatively similar, but differ quantitatively in the individual
components. The CHAPS complex is depleted of GPI-linked proteins and
retains a minor fraction of lipids similar in composition to that of the
Triton X-100 insoluble complex. We propose that in vivo the complexes form
part of a sorting platform that mediates protein segregation and delivery

air-water interface using titration experiments at constant ionic strength
and film expansion experiments at constant pH, with Li+, Na+, K+ and Cs+
in the subphase. For each lipid, the apparent pK in the surface is
strongly dependent on the subphase salt concentration and differs from
expected intrinsic pK in the bulk. Discrimination between alkaline cations
is observed. These results can be accounted for by strong surface
potentials, which are satisfactorily calculated by using the Gouy and
Chapman theory of the diffuse double layer. The comparison of C12PP and PG
expansion data shows the importance of the glycerol residue of PG ionic
properties, favouring penetration of cations in the films. Lipids in the
liquid-crystalline state, such as C12-and C15PG, do not interact with
alkaline cations as does C16PG in the gel phase. In particular, film
condensations bring about a clear-cut discrimination between Na+ and K+.
Results are discussed with regard to cation penetration and the structure

	abstract = {A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure
of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is
consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model,
the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of
globular molecules, each arranged in an amphipathic structure, that is,
with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into
the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the
hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are
partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the
phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a
small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane
proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a
two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins)
in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a
wide variety of techniqes and several different membrane systems are
described, all of which abet consistent with, and add much detail to, the
fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible
mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena
in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms
are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and
for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with
some specific ligands. Note added in proof: Since this article was
written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence (69) that the
concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed
mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the
membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in
Fig. 7B. T-here has also appeared a study by Taylor et al. (70) showing
the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of
antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The
antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface
immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37 degrees C the
surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These
effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by
their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried
out at 0 degrees C instead of 37 degrees C. These and related results
strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of
the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which
can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the
membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of
the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane
transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an
antibody response to an antigen, as well as iv other processes of cell
differentiation.},

charge between pH 3 and 9 are cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine,

membrane is phosphatidylserine, which comprises about 15–20 per cent of
the total lipids. According to Verkleijet al. (1973) this lipid resides
predominantly on the inner side of the membrane, demonstrating the
possibility of asymmetric charge distribution on the two membrane sides.
In the central nervous tissue the main acidic lipids are cerebroside
sulphate and serine phosphoglycerides (cf. London and Vossenberg, 1973). A

surfactants. When such a mixed vesicle binds an oppositely charged object,
its membrane partially demixes: the adhesion zone recruits more charged
surfactants from the rest of the membrane. Given an unlimited supply of
adhering objects one might expect the vesicle to remain attractive until
it was completely covered. Contrary to this expectation, we show that a
vesicle can instead exhibit adhesion saturation, partitioning
spontaneously into an attractive zone with definite area fraction, and a
repulsive zone. The latter zone rejects additional incoming objects
because counterions on the interior of the vesicle migrate there,
effectively reversing the membrane's charge. The effect is strongest at
high surface charge densities, low ionic strength, and with thin,
impermeable membranes. Adhesion saturation in such a situation has
recently been observed experimentally [H. Aranda-Espinoza et al., Science
285, 394 (1999)].},

100 amino acids that is found in several proteins involved in signal
transduction [for a recent review, see Gibson et al. (1994) Trends
Biochem. Sci. 19, 349-353]. Although the specific function of the PH
domain has not yet been elucidated, many of the proteins which contain
this domain associate with phospholipid membranes, and PH domains have
been shown to bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) [Harlan
et al. (1994) Nature 371, 168-170] and the beta gamma subunits of
G-proteins [Touhara et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10217-10220]. We
have postulated that pleckstrin homology domains may be important for the
translocation of proteins to the membrane by an interaction with the
negatively charged head group of phospholipids. Here we show the
importance of three conserved lysine residues for binding to PIP2 by
site-directed mutagenesis. These results should aid future site-directed
mutagenesis studies in probing the function of PIP2-PH domain interactions
in the various proteins containing this module. In addition, we examine
the specificity of this binding and illustrate the importance of
charge--charge interactions in PIP2-PH domain complex formation from
binding experiments involving PIP2 analogs.},

Brewster angle microscopy in a four-roll mill setup which applies a
transient strain and images the response. When a compact domain is
stretched by the imposed strain, it first assumes a bola shape with two
tear-drop shaped reservoirs connected by a thin tether which then slowly
relaxes to a circular domain which minimizes the interfacial energy of the
system. We process the digital images of the experiment to extract the
domain shapes. We then use one of these shapes as an initial condition for
the numerical solution of a boundary-integral model of the underlying
hydrodynamics and compare the subsequent images of the experiment to the
numerical simulation. The numerical evolutions first verify that our
hydrodynamical model can reproduce the observed dynamics. They also allow
us to deduce the magnitude of the line tension in the system, often to
within 1\%. We find line tensions in the range of 200-600pN; we hypothesize
that this variation is due to differences in the layer depths of the 8CB

	abstract = {Smooth muscle basic calponin, a major actin-, tropomyosin-, and
calmodulin-binding protein, has been examined for its ability to interact
with desmin intermediate filaments from smooth muscle cells using
sedimentation analysis, turbidity changes, chemical cross-linking,
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (MALDI TOF/MS), and electron microscopic observations.
Calponin interacted with desmin intermediate filaments in a
concentration-dependent manner in vitro. The binding of calponin to desmin
produced dense aggregates at 30 degrees C. The dense aggregates were
observed by electron microscopy to be composed of large anisotropic
bundles of desmin filaments, indicating that calponin forms bundles of
desmin filaments. The addition of calmodulin or S100 to the mixture of
calponin and desmin caused the removal of calponin from the desmin
filaments and inhibited bundle formation in the presence of Ca(2+), but
not in the presence of EGTA. Calponin-related proteins including G-actin,
tropomyosin, and SM22, had little effect on the binding of calponin to
desmin filaments, whereas tubulin weakly inhibited the binding. Desmin had
little influence on the calponin-actin and calponin-tubulin interactions
using the zero-length cross-linker, EDC. Domain mapping with chymotryptic
digestion showed that the binding site of calponin resides within the
central a-helical rod domain of the desmin molecule. The chemical
cross-linked products of calponin and synthetic peptides (TQ27,
TNEKVELQELNDRFANYIEKVRFLEQQ; EE24, EEELRELRRQVDALTGQRARVEVE) derived from
the rod domain were detected by MALDI TOF/MS. Furthermore, the
calponin-desmin interaction was significantly inhibited by the addition of
EE24, but only slightly by TQ27. These results suggest that calponin may
act as a cross-linking protein between desmin filaments as well as among
intermediate filaments, microfilaments and microtubules in smooth muscle
cells.},

been published about the nature of the helical structure of HA in the

underlying the formation and stabilization of ordered structures and their
interactions with counterions. The conformational spaces available and the
low energy conformations for the disaccharide, trisaccharide, and
tetrasaccharide segments of HA were investigated via molecular mechanics
calculations using the MM3 force field. First, the results were used to
access the configurational statistics of the corresponding polysaccharide.
A disordered chain having a persistence length of 75 A at 25 degrees C is
predicted. Then, the exploration of the stable ordered forms of HA led to
numerous helical conformations, both left- and right-handed, having
comparable energies. Several of these conformations correspond to the
experimentally observed ones and illustrate the versatility of the
polysaccharide. The double stranded helical forms have also been explored
and theoretical structures have been compared to experimentally derived

significantly alters the bundle size and size distribution. The onset of
bundle formation takes place at earlier Bjerrum length values with
increasing trivalent counterion concentration. For the cases of 80\%, 95\%,

the bundles decreases with increasing size. We suggest that competition
among two different mechanisms, counterion condensation and merger of
bundles, leads to a nonmonotonic change in line-charge density with
increasing Bjerrum length. The investigated case of having an abundance of
trivalent counterions by 200\% prohibits such a behavior. In this case, we
find that the difference in effective line-charge density of different

addition of polyvalent cations, but the much larger diameter of actin
rings reflects the greater bending stiffness of F-actin. Actin rings can
also be formed by addition of streptavidin to crosslink sparsely
biotinylated F-actin at very low concentrations. The energy of bending in
a ring, calculated from the persistence length of F-actin and the ring

	abstract = {Aggregation of two oppositely charged colloids in salty water is studied.
We focus on the role of Coulomb interaction in strongly asymmetric systems
in which the charge and size of one colloid is much larger than the other
one. In the solution, each large colloid (macroion) attracts a certain
number of oppositely charged small colloids (Z-ion) to form a complex. If
the concentration ratio of the two colloids is such that complexes are not
strongly charged, they condense in a macroscopic aggregate. As a result,
the phase diagram in a plane of concentrations of two colloids consists of
an aggregation domain sandwiched between two domains of stable solutions
of complexes. The aggregation domain has a central part of total
aggregation and two wings corresponding to partial aggregation. A
quantitative theory of the phase diagram in the presence of monovalent
salt is developed. It is shown that as the Debye-Hückel screening radius

	abstract = {Magnesium ions have an important role in the structure and folding
mechanism of ribonucleic acid systems. To properly simulate these
biophysical processes, the applied molecular models should reproduce,
among other things, the kinetic properties of the ions in water solution.
Here, we have studied the kinetics of the binding of magnesium ions with
water molecules and nucleic acid systems using molecular dynamics
simulation in detail. We have validated the parameters used in
biomolecular force fields, such as AMBER and CHARMM, for Mg(2+) ions and
also for the biologically relevant ions Na(+), K(+), and Ca(2+) together
with three different water models (TIP3P, SPC/E, and TIP5P). The results
show that Mg(2+) ions have a slower exchange rate than Na(+), K(+), and
Ca(2+) in agreement with the experimental trend, but the simulated value
underestimates the experimentally observed Mg(2+)-water exchange rate by
several orders of magnitude, irrespective of the force field and water
model. A new set of parameters for Mg(2+) was developed to reproduce the
experimental kinetic data. This set also leads to better reproduction of
structural data than existing models. We have applied the new parameter
set to Mg(2+) binding with a monophosphate model system and with the
purine riboswitch, add A-riboswitch. In line with the Mg(2+)-water
results, the newly developed parameters show a better description of the
structure and kinetics of the Mg(2+)-phosphate binding than all other
models. The characterization of the ion binding to the riboswitch system
shows that the new parameter set does not affect the global structure of
the ribonucleic acid system or the number of ions involved in direct or
indirect binding. A slight decrease in the number of water-bridged
contacts between A-riboswitch and the Mg(2+) ion is observed. The results
support the ability of the newly developed parameters to improve the
kinetic description of the Mg(2+) and phosphate ions and their
applicability in nucleic acid simulation.},

human skeletal muscle containing different myosin isoforms. Permeabilized
fibers were activated by laser-pulse photolytic release of 1.5 mM ATP from
p(3)-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethylester of ATP. The ATP hydrolysis rate in the
muscle fibers was determined with a fluorescently labeled
phosphate-binding protein. The effects of varying load and shortening
velocity during contraction were investigated. The myosin isoform
composition was determined in each fiber by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. At 12 degrees C large
variations (three- to fourfold) were found between slow and fast (2A and
2A-2B) fibers in their maximum shortening velocity, peak power output,
velocity at which peak power is produced, isometric ATPase activity, and
tension cost. Isometric tension was similar in all fiber groups. The ATP
consumption rate increased during shortening in proportion to shortening
velocity. At 12 degrees C the maximum efficiency was similar (0.21-0.27)
for all fiber types and was reached at a higher speed of shortening for
the faster fibers. In all fibers, peak efficiency increased to
approximately 0.4 when the temperature was raised from 12 degrees C to 20
degrees C. The results were simulated with a kinetic scheme describing the
ATPase cycle, in which the rate constant controlling ADP release is
sensitive to the load on the muscle. The main difference between slow and
fast fibers was reproduced by increasing the rate constant for the
hydrolysis step, which was rate limiting at low loads. Simulation of the
effect of increasing temperature required an increase in the force per

electronic relaxation processes in solution in which the intramolecular
potential surface does not present a barrier to the motion leading to the
decay of the initially formed excited state. We model the reactive motion
as the motion of a solute particle on the excited state potential surface
with a position dependent sink which gives rise to the decay of the
excited state population. Three different types of sinks are considered:
(A) a pinhole sink at the minimum of the potential surface; this models
the situation when the molecule decays to ground state as soon as it
reaches the potential minimum; (B) a Gaussian sink with probability of
decay maximum at the potential minimum; (C) a Lorentzian sink with maximum
decay at the potential minimum. For case (A) an explicit analytic solution
is obtained for the decay rate, but for cases (B) and (C) we obtained the
decay rate numerically. Model (A) predicts nonexponential decay at all
viscosities except at long times when the decay is single exponential. For
cases (B) and (C) the decay is single exponential at low viscosities but
becomes multiexponential at high viscosities. We show that the
experimentally observed fractional viscosity dependence of fluorescence
quantum yield arises naturally in this theory due to the position
dependence of the sink as well as due to the competition between radiative
and nonradiative relaxation. Our model also predicts a crossover from an
apparent negative (constant viscosity) activation energy at low
viscosities to a positive activation energy at high viscosity. The
physical significance of these results is discussed in light of the
available experimental results on TPM dye relaxation. Some possible

	abstract = {To design functional photoactive materials for a variety of technological
applications, researchers need to understand their electronic properties
in detail and have ways to control their photoinduced pathways. When
excited by photons of light, organic conjugated materials (OCMs) show
dynamics that are often characterized by large nonadiabatic (NA) couplings
between multiple excited states through a breakdown of the
Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. Following photoexcitation, various
nonradiative intraband relaxation pathways can lead to a number of complex
processes. Therefore, computational simulation of nonadiabatic molecular
dynamics is an indispensable tool for understanding complex photoinduced
processes such as internal conversion, energy transfer, charge separation,
and spatial localization of excitons. Over the years, we have developed a
nonadiabatic excited-state molecular dynamics (NA-ESMD) framework that
efficiently and accurately describes photoinduced phenomena in extended
conjugated molecular systems. We use the fewest-switches surface hopping
(FSSH) algorithm to treat quantum transitions among multiple adiabatic
excited state potential energy surfaces (PESs). Extended molecular systems
often contain hundreds of atoms and involve large densities of excited
states that participate in the photoinduced dynamics. We can achieve an
accurate description of the multiple excited states using the
configuration interaction single (CIS) formalism with a semiempirical
model Hamiltonian. Analytical techniques allow the trajectory to be
propagated "on the fly" using the complete set of NA coupling terms and
remove computational bottlenecks in the evaluation of excited-state
gradients and NA couplings. Furthermore, the use of state-specific
gradients for propagation of nuclei on the native excited-state PES
eliminates the need for simplifications such as the classical path
approximation (CPA), which only uses ground-state gradients. Thus, the
NA-ESMD methodology offers a computationally tractable route for
simulating hundreds of atoms on {\textasciitilde}10 ps time scales where multiple coupled
excited states are involved. In this Account, we review recent
developments in the NA-ESMD modeling of photoinduced dynamics in extended
conjugated molecules involving multiple coupled electronic states. We have
successfully applied the outlined NA-ESMD framework to study ultrafast
conformational planarization in polyfluorenes where the rate of torsional
relaxation can be controlled based on the initial excitation. With the
addition of the state reassignment algorithm to identify instances of
unavoided crossings between noninteracting PESs, NA-ESMD can now be used
to study systems in which these so-called trivial unavoided crossings are
expected to predominate. We employ this technique to analyze the energy
transfer between poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) segments where
conformational fluctuations give rise to numerous instances of unavoided
crossings leading to multiple pathways and complex energy transfer
dynamics that cannot be described using a simple Förster model. In
addition, we have investigated the mechanism of ultrafast unidirectional
energy transfer in dendrimers composed of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)
chromophores and have demonstrated that differential nuclear motion favors
downhill energy transfer in dendrimers. The use of native excited-state
gradients allows us to observe this feature.},

	abstract = {Development of accurate force field parameters for molecular ions in the
context of a polarizable energy function based on the classical Drude
oscillator is a crucial step towards an accurate polarizable model for
modeling and simulations of biological macromolecules. Towards this goal
we have undertaken a hierarchical approach in which force field parameter
optimization is initially performed for small molecules for which
experimental data exists that serve as building blocks of macromolecular
systems. Small molecules representative of the ionic moieties of
biological macromolecules include the cationic ammonium and methyl
substituted ammonium derivatives, imidazolium, guanidinium and
methylguanidinium and the anionic acetate, phenolate and alkanethiolates.
In the present work, parameters for molecular ions in the context of the
Drude polarizable force field are optimized and compared to results from
the nonpolarizable additive CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF).
Electrostatic and Lennard-Jones parameters for the model compounds are
developed in the context of the polarizable SWM4-NDP water model, with
emphasis on assuring that the hydration free energies are consistent with
previous reported parameters for atomic ions. The final parameters are
shown to be in good agreement with the selected QM and experimental target
data. Analysis of the structure of water around the ions reveal a
substantial differences between the Drude and additive force fields
indicating an important role of polarization in dictating the molecular
details of aqueous solvation. The presented parameters represent the
foundation for the charged functionalities in future generations of the
Drude polarizable force field for biological macromolecules as well as for
drug-like molecules.},

from molecular dynamics simulations is a long-sought but elusive goal. The
problem is particularly relevant for processes occurring in biological
systems, as is the case for ligand-protein and ligand-membrane
interactions. Several formalisms to determine rate constants from easily
accessible free-energy profiles [Δ Go( z)] of a molecule along a
coordinate of interest have been proposed. However, their applicability
for molecular interactions in condensed media has not been critically
evaluated or validated. This work presents such evaluation and validation
and introduces improved methodology. As a case study, we have
characterized quantitatively the rate of translocation of cholesterol
across 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayers.
Translocation across lipid bilayers is the rate-limiting step in the
permeation of most drugs through biomembranes. We use coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations and different kinetic formalisms to
calculate this rate constant. A self-consistent test of the applicability
of various available formalisms is provided by comparing their predictions
with the translocation rates obtained from actual events observed in long
unrestrained simulations. To this effect, a novel procedure was used to
obtain the effective rate constant, based on an analysis of time intervals
between transitions among different states along the reaction coordinate.
While most tested formalisms lead to results in reasonable agreement
(within a factor of 5) with this effective rate constant, the most
adequate one is based on the explicit relaxation frequencies from the
transition state in the forward and backward directions along the reaction
coordinate.},

non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The theory of stochastic pumping has
provided insight into how a non-equilibrium steady-state can be formed and

of them derived from benign pancreatic duct cells. RESULTS: Out of 1,540

upregulated and 18 downregulated in tumor cell lines compared to benign
cells with a fold change {\textgreater}3. Several of the upregulated genes (like
Prefoldin 5, ADAM9 and E-cadherin) have been associated with pancreatic
cancer before. The other differentially regulated genes, however, play a
so far unknown role in the course of human pancreatic carcinoma. By means
of immunohistochemistry we could show that thymosin beta-10 (TMSB10),
upregulated in tumor cell lines, is expressed in human pancreatic
carcinoma, but not in non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue, suggesting a role
for TMSB10 in the carcinogenesis of pancreatic carcinoma. CONCLUSION:

It is concluded that the agreement between experimental data and

this region which makes the correct computation of the electrostatics more

complex in nature and include both territorial and site specific binding.
Commonly employed nonbonded divalent ion models, however, are often
parametrized against bulk ion properties and are subsequently utilized in
biomolecular simulations without considering any data related to
interactions at specific nucleic acid sites. Previously, we assessed the
ability of 17 different nonbonded Mg(2+) ion models to reproduce different
properties of Mg(2+) in aqueous solution including radial distribution
functions, solvation free energies, water exchange rates, and
translational diffusion coefficients. In the present work, we depart from
the recently developed 12-6-4 potential models for divalent metal ions
developed by Li and Merz and tune the pairwise parameters for Mg(2+),
Mn(2+), Zn(2+), and Cd(2+) binding dimethyl phosphate, adenosine, and
guanosine in order to reproduce experimental site specific binding free
energies derived from potentiometric pH titration data. We further apply
these parameters to investigate a metal ion migration previously proposed
to occur during the catalytic reaction of the hammerhead ribozyme. The new
parameters are shown to be accurate and balanced for nucleic acid binding
in comparison with available experimental data and provide an important
tool for molecular dynamics and free energy simulations of nucleic acids

	abstract = {The prevalence of Mg(2+) ions in biology and their essential role in
nucleic acid structure and function has motivated the development of
various Mg(2+) ion models for use in molecular simulations. Currently, the
most widely used models in biomolecular simulations represent a nonbonded
metal ion as an ion-centered point charge surrounded by a nonelectrostatic
pairwise potential that takes into account dispersion interactions and
exchange effects that give rise to the ion's excluded volume. One strategy
toward developing improved models for biomolecular simulations is to first
identify a Mg(2+) model that is consistent with the simulation force
fields that closely reproduces a range of properties in aqueous solution,
and then, in a second step, balance the ion-water and ion-solute
interactions by tuning parameters in a pairwise fashion where necessary.
The present work addresses the first step in which we compare 17 different
nonbonded single-site Mg(2+) ion models with respect to their ability to
simultaneously reproduce structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and mass
transport properties in aqueous solution. None of the models based on a
12-6 nonelectrostatic nonbonded potential was able to reproduce the
experimental radial distribution function, solvation free energy, exchange
barrier and diffusion constant. The models based on a 12-6-4 potential
offered improvement, and one model in particular, in conjunction with the
SPC/E water model, performed exceptionally well for all properties. The
results reported here establish useful benchmark calculations for Mg(2+)
ion models that provide insight into the origin of the behavior in aqueous
solution, and may aid in the development of next-generation models that
target specific binding sites in biomolecules.},

ability of participants to evaluate not just their statistical

predict the magnitude of their model or force field error for specific
predictions. Unfortunately, this remains an area where prediction and
analysis need improvement. In SAMPL4 the top performing submissions
achieved a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) around 1.5 kcal/mol. If we
anticipate accuracy in log D predictions to be similar to the hydration
free energy predictions in SAMPL4, the expected error here would be around
1.54 log units. Only a few submissions had an RMSE below 2.5 log units in
their predicted log D values. However, distribution coefficients
introduced complexities not present in past SAMPL challenges, including
tautomer enumeration, that are likely to be important in predicting
biomolecular properties of interest to drug discovery, therefore some
decrease in accuracy would be expected. Overall, the SAMPL5 distribution

An analytical formula for removing intramolecular polarization from a set
of atomic multipoles for an arbitrary static structure or conformation is
given. With the help of the intramolecular polarization, these permanent
atomic multipoles can then be applied in modeling alternative
conformations of a molecule. Equipped with this simple technique, one can
derive transferable electrostatic parameters for peptides and proteins
using flexible model compounds such as dipeptides. The proposed procedure
is tested for its ability to describe the electrostatic potential around
various configurations of the N-methylacetamide dimer. The effect of
different intramolecular polarization schemes on the accuracy of a force
field model of the electrostatic potential of alanine dipeptide is
investigated. A group-based scheme for including direct intramolecular
polarization is shown to be most successful in accounting for the
conformational dependence of electrostatic potentials. {\textbackslash}textcopyright 2002

MMFF94, OPLS, CHELPG electrostatic potential fit, QEq, Gasteiger, and
Abraham charges for 20 small molecules and ions also shows the close
correspondence between MMFF94 and OPLS. As do OPLS and all current, widely
used force fields, MMFF94 employs ``effective pair potentials'' which
incorporate in an averaged way the increases in polarity which occur in
high dielectric media. Some limitations of this approach are discussed and
suggestions for possible enhancements to MMFF94's functional form are

Despite the importance of solubility in determining the oral
bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, prediction tools are currently limited
to quantitative structure{\textbackslash}textendashproperty relationships that are fit to
experimental solubility measurements. For the first time, we describe a
consistent procedure for the prediction of the structure, thermodynamic
stability, and solubility of organic crystals from molecular dynamics
simulations using the polarizable multipole AMOEBA force field. Our
approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state
solubility into the sum of solid{\textbackslash}textendashvapor sublimation and
vapor{\textbackslash}textendashliquid solvation free energies \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gsolubility\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$
= \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gsub\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ + \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gsolv\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, which are computed via the
orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) sampling strategy. Application to the
n-alkylamides series from acetamide through octanamide was selected due to
the dependence of their solubility on both amide hydrogen bonding and the
hydrophobic effect, which are each fundamental to protein structure and
solubility. On average, the calculated absolute standard state solubility
free energies are accurate to within 1.1 kcal/mol. The experimental trend
of decreasing solubility as a function of n-alkylamide chain length is
recapitulated by the increasing stability of the crystalline state and to
a lesser degree by decreasing favorability of solvation (i.e., the
hydrophobic effect). Our results suggest that coupling the polarizable
AMOEBA force field with an orthogonal space based free energy algorithm,
as implemented in the program Force Field X, is a consistent procedure for
predicting the structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of
organic crystals.},

biology for predicting the structures of ligand{\textbackslash}textendashreceptor

factors such as the neglect of protein reorganization in the scoring

positive hits. Although absolute binding free energy methods still have
difficulty in accurately rank-ordering binders, we believe that they can
be fruitfully employed to distinguish binders from nonbinders and reduce
the false positive rate. Here we study a set of ligands that dock
favorably to a newly discovered, potentially allosteric site on the flap
of HIV-1 protease. Fragment binding to this site stabilizes a closed form
of protease, which could be exploited for the design of allosteric
inhibitors. Twenty-three top-ranked protein{\textbackslash}textendashligand complexes
from AutoDock were subject to the free energy screening using two methods,
the recently developed binding energy analysis method (BEDAM) and the
standard double decoupling method (DDM). Free energy calculations
correctly identified most of the false positives (\${\textbackslash}geq\$83\%) and recovered
all the confirmed binders. The results show a gap averaging \${\textbackslash}geq\$3.7
kcal/mol, separating the binders and the false positives. We present a
formula that decomposes the binding free energy into contributions from
the receptor conformational macrostates, which provides insights into the
roles of different binding modes. Our binding free energy component
analysis further suggests that improving the treatment for the desolvation
penalty associated with the unfulfilled polar groups could reduce the rate
of false positive hits in docking. The current study demonstrates that the
combination of docking with free energy methods can be very useful for
more accurate ligand screening against valuable drug targets.},

	abstract = {The solubility of organic molecules is of critical importance to the
pharmaceutical industry; however, robust computational methods to predict
this quantity from first-principles are lacking. Solubility can be
computed from a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state
solubility into the sum of solid{\textbackslash}textendashvapor sublimation and
vapor{\textbackslash}textendashliquid solvation free energies \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gsolubility\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$
= \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gsub\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ + \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gsolv\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$. Over the past few decades,
alchemical simulation methods to compute solvation free energy using
classical force fields have become widely used. However, analogous methods
for determining the free energy of the sublimation/deposition phase
transition are currently limited by the necessity of a priori knowledge of
the atomic coordinates of the crystal. Here, we describe progress toward
an alternative scheme based on growth of the asymmetric unit into a
crystal via alchemy (GAUCHE). GAUCHE computes deposition free energy
\${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gdep\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ = -\${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gsub\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ = -kBT ln(Vc/Vg) +
\${\textbackslash}Delta\$GAU + \${\textbackslash}Delta\$GAU\${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$UC as the sum of an entropic term to
account for compressing a vapor at 1 M standard state (Vg) into the molar
volume of the crystal (Vc), where kB is Boltzmann's constant and T is
temperature in degrees Kelvin, plus two simulation steps. In the first
simulation step, the deposition free energy \${\textbackslash}Delta\$GAU for a system
composed of only NAU asymmetric unit (AU) molecule(s) is computed
beginning from an arbitrary conformation in vacuum. In the second
simulation step, the change in free energy \${\textbackslash}Delta\$GAU\${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$UC to
expand the asymmetric unit degrees of freedom into a unit cell (UC)
composed of NUC independent molecules is computed. This latter step
accounts for the favorable free energy of removing the constraint that
every symmetry mate of the asymmetric unit has an identical conformation
and intermolecular interactions. The current work is based on NVT
simulations, which requires knowledge of the crystal space group and unit
cell parameters from experiment, but not a priori knowledge of crystalline
atomic coordinates. GAUCHE was applied to 5 organic molecules whose
sublimation free energy has been measured experimentally, based on the
polarizable AMOEBA force field and more than a microsecond of sampling per
compound in the program Force Field X. The mean unsigned and RMS errors
were only 1.6 and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively, which indicates that GAUCHE
is capable of accurate prediction of absolute sublimation thermodynamics.},

fields. Alchemical free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics
simulations provide a rigorous way to calculate these free energies for a
particular force field, given sufficient sampling. Here, we report results
of alchemical hydration free energy calculations for the set of small
molecules comprising the 2011 Statistical Assessment of Modeling of
Proteins and Ligands challenge. Our calculations are largely based on the
Generalized Amber Force Field with several different charge models, and we
achieved RMS errors in the 1.4-2.2 kcal/mol range depending on charge
model, marginally higher than what we typically observed in previous
studies (Mobley et al. in J Phys Chem B 111(9):2242-2254, 2007, J Chem
Theory Comput 5(2):350-358, 2009, J Phys Chem B 115:1329-1332, 2011;
Nicholls et al. in J Med Chem 51:769-779, 2008; Klimovich and Mobley in J
Comput Aided Mol Design 24(4):307-316, 2010). The test set consists of
ethane, biphenyl, and a dibenzyl dioxin, as well as a series of
chlorinated derivatives of each. We found that, for this set, using
high-quality partial charges from MP2/cc-PVTZ SCRF RESP fits provided
marginally improved agreement with experiment over using AM1-BCC partial
charges as we have more typically done, in keeping with our recent
findings (Mobley et al. in J Phys Chem B 115:1329-1332, 2011). Switching
to OPLS Lennard-Jones parameters with AM1-BCC charges also improves
agreement with experiment. We also find a number of chemical trends within
each molecular series which we can explain, but there are also some
surprises, including some that are captured by the calculations and some
that are not.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data
including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten.
The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord
with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18\%
overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and
TIP4P potentials yield oxygen{\textbackslash}textendashoxygen partial structure functions
in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with
the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however,
the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential
functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction
terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly
neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for
self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.
Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural
and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful
in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and

some observed properties; for example, the choice of cutoff can affect
computed free energies of ligand binding to proteins by 1 to 2 kcal/mol.
We review current methods for eliminating this cutoff-dependent behavior
of the dispersion energy and identify some situations where they fail. We
introduce two new formalisms, appropriate for binding free energy
calculations, which overcome these failings, requiring minimal
computational effort beyond the time required to run the original
simulation. When these cutoff approximations are applied, which can be
done after all simulations are completed, results are consistent across
simulations run with different cutoffs. In many situations, simulations
can be run with even shorter cutoffs than typically used, resulting in
increased computational efficiency.},

poses within a given protein crystal structure using GPU-accelerated
Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The
Hamiltonians used vary from the physical end state of protein interacting
with the ligand to an unphysical end state where the ligand does not
interact with the protein. As replicas explore the space of Hamiltonians
interpolating between these states, the ligand can rapidly escape local
minima and explore potential binding sites. Geometric restraints keep the
ligands from leaving the vicinity of the protein and an alchemical pathway
designed to increase phase space overlap between intermediates ensures
good mixing. Because of the rigorous statistical mechanical nature of the
Hamiltonian exchange framework, we can also extract binding free energy
estimates for all putative binding sites. We present results of this
methodology applied to the T4 lysozyme L99A model system for three known
ligands and one non-binder as a control, using an implicit solvent. We
find that our methodology identifies known crystallographic binding sites
consistently and accurately for the small number of ligands considered
here and gives free energies consistent with experiment. We are also able
to analyze the contribution of individual binding sites to the overall
binding affinity. Our methodology points to near term potential
applications in early-stage structure-guided drug discovery.},

molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF,
the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This
study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and
summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental
data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways
intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in
molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like
accuracy for small molecules in a combined ``organic/protein'' force field
that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological
significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of
MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational
data{\textbackslash}textemdashca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G*
level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G*
structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level,
and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and
evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that
MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of
interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature
frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little,
if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in
parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather
than using the common ``functional group'' approach, nearly all MMFF
parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the
full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the
computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition,
MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square
[rms]), bond angles (1.2\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm-1
rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers
(0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable
systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in
hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the
highly regarded OPLS force field. {\textbackslash}textcopyright 1996 John Wiley \& Sons,

	abstract = {Molecular mechanics force fields are widely used in computer-aided drug
design for the study of drug-like molecules alone or interacting with
biological systems. In simulations involving biological macromolecules,
the biological part is typically represented by a specialized biomolecular
force field, while the drug is represented by a matching general (organic)
force field. In order to apply these general force fields to an arbitrary
drug-like molecule, functionality for assignment of atom types,
parameters, and charges is required. In the present article, which is part
I of a series of two, we present the algorithms for bond perception and
atom typing for the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF). The CGenFF atom
typer first associates attributes to the atoms and bonds in a molecule,
such as valence, bond order, and ring membership among others. Of note are
a number of features that are specifically required for CGenFF. This
information is then used by the atom typing routine to assign CGenFF atom
types based on a programmable decision tree. This allows for
straightforward implementation of CGenFF's complicated atom typing rules
and for equally straightforward updating of the atom typing scheme as the
force field grows. The presented atom typer was validated by assigning
correct atom types on 477 model compounds including in the training set as
well as 126 test-set molecules that were constructed to specifically
verify its different components. The program may be utilized via an online

	abstract = {In this study, we present conformational energies for a molecular
mechanical model (Parm99) developed for organic and biological molecules
using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) approach to derive the
partial charges. This approach uses the simple ``generic'' force field
model (Parm94), and attempts to add a minimal number of extra Fourier
components to the torsional energies, but doing so only when there is a
physical justification. The results are quite encouraging, not only for
the 34-molecule set that has been studied by both the highest level ab
initiomodel (GVB/LMP2) and experiment, but also for the 55-molecule set
for which high-quality experimental data are available. Considering the 55
molecules studied by all the force field models for which there are
experimental data, the average absolute errors (AAEs) are 0.28 (this
model), 0.52 (MM3), 0.57 (CHARMm [MSI]), and 0.43 kcal/mol (MMFF). For the
34-molecule set, the AAEs of this model versus experiment and ab initio
are 0.28 and 0.27 kcal/mol, respectively. This is a lower error than found
with MM3 and CHARMm, and is comparable to that found with MMFF (0.31 and
0.22 kcal/mol). We also present two examples of how well the torsional
parameters are transferred from the training set to the test set. The
absolute errors of molecules in the test set are only slightly larger than
in the training set (differences of \${\textless}\$0.1 kcal/mol). Therefore, it can be
concluded that a simple ``generic'' force field with a limited number of
specific torsional parameters can describe intra- and intermolecular
interactions, although all comparison molecules were selected from our
82-compound training set. We also show how this effective two-body model
can be extended for use with a nonadditive force field (NAFF), both with
and without lone pairs. Without changing the torsional parameters, the use
of more accurate charges and polarization leads to an increase in average
absolute error compared with experiment, but adjustment of the parameters
restores the level of agreement found with the additive model. After
reoptimizing the \${\textbackslash}Psi\$, \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ torsional parameters in peptides using
alanine dipeptide (6 conformational pairs) and alanine tetrapeptide (11
conformational pairs), the new model gives better energies than the
Cornell et al. ( J Am Chem Soc 1995, 117, 5179{\textbackslash}textendash5197) force
field. The average absolute error of this model for high-level ab initio
calculation is 0.82 kcal/mol for alanine dipeptide and tetrapeptide as
compared with 1.80 kcal/mol for the Cornell et al. model. For nucleosides,
the new model also gives improved energies compared with the Cornell et
al. model. To optimize force field parameters, we developed a program
called parmscan, which can iteratively scan the torsional parameters in a
systematic manner and finally obtain the best torsional potentials.
Besides the organic molecules in our test set, parmscan was also
successful in optimizing the \${\textbackslash}Psi\$, \${\textbackslash}Phi\$ torsional parameters in
peptides to significantly improve agreement between molecular mechanical
and high-level ab initio energies. {\textbackslash}textcopyright 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

	abstract = {Binding selectivity is a requirement for the development of a safe drug,
and it is a critical property for chemical probes used in preclinical
target validation. Engineering selectivity adds considerable complexity to
the rational design of new drugs, as it involves the optimization of
multiple binding affinities. Computationally, the prediction of binding
selectivity is a challenge, and generally applicable methodologies are
still not available to the computational and medicinal chemistry
communities. Absolute binding free energy calculations based on alchemical
pathways provide a rigorous framework for affinity predictions and could
thus offer a general approach to the problem. We evaluated the performance
of free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics for the prediction
of selectivity by estimating the affinity profile of three bromodomain
inhibitors across multiple bromodomain families, and by comparing the
results to isothermal titration calorimetry data. Two case studies were
considered. In the first one, the affinities of two similar ligands for
seven bromodomains were calculated and returned excellent agreement with
experiment (mean unsigned error of 0.81 kcal/mol and Pearson correlation
of 0.75). In this test case, we also show how the preferred binding
orientation of a ligand for different proteins can be estimated via free
energy calculations. In the second case, the affinities of a
broad-spectrum inhibitor for 22 bromodomains were calculated and returned
a more modest accuracy (mean unsigned error of 1.76 kcal/mol and Pearson
correlation of 0.48); however, the reparametrization of a sulfonamide
moiety improved the agreement with experiment.},

a parallelized Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method combined with
the Laplace Asymptotic Approximation. The suitability of the hierarchical

the MD model. We demonstrate the selection of MD models based on

quantify the uncertainty across experiments; improve the posterior
probability density function estimation of the parameters, thus, improve

	abstract = {ConspectusA principal goal of drug discovery project is to design
molecules that can tightly and selectively bind to the target protein
receptor. Accurate prediction of protein{\textbackslash}textendashligand binding free
energies is therefore of central importance in computational chemistry and
computer aided drug design. Multiple recent improvements in computing
power, classical force field accuracy, enhanced sampling methods, and
simulation setup have enabled accurate and reliable calculations of
protein{\textbackslash}textendashligands binding free energies, and position free energy
calculations to play a guiding role in small molecule drug discovery. In
this Account, we outline the relevant methodological advances, including
the REST2 (Replica Exchange with Solute Temperting) enhanced sampling, the
incorporation of REST2 sampling with convential FEP (Free Energy
Perturbation) through FEP/REST, the OPLS3 force field, and the advanced
simulation setup that constitute our FEP+ approach, followed by the
presentation of extensive comparisons with experiment, demonstrating
sufficient accuracy in potency prediction (better than 1 kcal/mol) to
substantially impact lead optimization campaigns. The limitations of the
current FEP+ implementation and best practices in drug discovery
applications are also discussed followed by the future methodology
development plans to address those limitations. We then report results
from a recent drug discovery project, in which several thousand FEP+
calculations were successfully deployed to simultaneously optimize
potency, selectivity, and solubility, illustrating the power of the
approach to solve challenging drug design problems.The capabilities of
free energy calculations to accurately predict potency and selectivity
have led to the advance of ongoing drug discovery projects, in challenging
situations where alternative approaches would have great difficulties. The
ability to effectively carry out projects evaluating tens of thousands, or
hundreds of thousands, of proposed drug candidates, is potentially
transformative in enabling hard to drug targets to be attacked, and in
facilitating the development of superior compounds, in various dimensions,
for a wide range of targets. More effective integration of FEP+
calculations into the drug discovery process will ensure that the results
are deployed in an optimal fashion for yielding the best possible
compounds entering the clinic; this is where the greatest payoff is in the
exploitation of computer driven design capabilities.A key conclusion from
the work described is the surprisingly robust and accurate results that
are attainable within the conventional classical simulation, fixed charge
paradigm. No doubt there are individual cases that would benefit from a
more sophisticated energy model or dynamical treatment, and properties
other than protein{\textbackslash}textendashligand binding energies may be more sensitive
to these approximations. We conclude that an inflection point in the
ability of MD simulations to impact drug discovery has now been attained,
due to the confluence of hardware and software development along with the
formulation of ``good enough'' theoretical methods and models.},

lead to significant improvement in the calculated dielectric constant and
hydration free energy values for a wide variety of small molecule alcohol
models. Tests of the GAFF-DC parameters in the SAMPL4 blind prediction
event for hydration show these changes improve agreement with experiment.
Surprisingly, these simple modifications also outperform detailed quantum

working on the recently released Generalized Amber Force Field parameter
set (GAFF2). AM1/BCC charges are computed using the Public Domain MOPAC7
program and the bond charge corrections (BCC) reported in Jakalian, A.;
Jack, D. B.; Bayly, C. I.; J. Comp. Chem., 2002, 23, 1623{\textbackslash}textendash1641.
The interface has been tested on about 52,000 compounds (identified with a
CAS registry number) taken from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Open
Database. PrimaDORAC has been found to be very reliable, producing GAFF2
minimized structures bearing a mean root square displacement of about
0.01{\textbackslash}textendash0.02 nm with respect to the original CORINA-generated 3D
NCI structures. As a demonstrative example, we release the full topology

available for the molecules. This database is available for free download
(http://zinc.docking.org) in several common file formats including SMILES,

However, the most common model for electrostatic
interactions{\textbackslash}textemdashatomic point charges{\textbackslash}textemdashfails to reproduce
anisotropic charge distributions, such as lone pairs and sigma holes.
Although this has long been known, point charges are still widely used in
chemical modeling and reasoning. In this contribution, we analyze the
deficiency of atomic point charges in reproducing the electrostatic
potential (ESP) around molecules and find that multipole moments up to
quadrupoles can, with a much lower error than point charges, reproduce the
relevant ESP for all cases. Mapping the surface to the closest atom allows
to compare ESP errors between atom types and to identify cases with the
most urgent need for atomic multipoles. Our analysis shows that almost all
heteroatoms require multipoles to correctly describe their charge
distribution, with the most serious cases being nitrogen, sulfur, and
halogens. Comparison with small molecule crystallography data studies
supports our findings and emphasizes the need for incorporating
anisotropic charge descriptions in chemical models. The scheme introduced
here can be used to identify anisotropic binding preferences for atom
types where there is too little coverage in crystal structure databases.},

solvent, we compute the hydration free energies of 504 neutral small
organic molecules and compare them to experiments. We find, first, good
general agreement between the simulations and the experiments, with an RMS
error of 1.24 kcal/mol over the whole set (i.e., about 2 kT) and a
correlation coefficient of 0.89. Second, we use an automated procedure to
identify systematic errors for some classes of compounds, and suggest some
improvements to the force field. We find that alkyne hydration free
energies are particularly poorly predicted due to problems with a
Lennard-Jones well depth, and find that an alternate choice for this well
depth largely rectifies the situation. Third, we study the non-polar
component of hydration free energies - that is, the part that is not due
to electrostatics. While we find that repulsive and attractive components
of the non-polar part both scale roughly with surface area (or volume) of
the solute, the total non-polar free energy does not scale with the solute
surface area or volume, because it is a small difference between large
components and is dominated by the deviations from the trend. While the
methods used here are not new, this is a more extensive test than previous
explicit solvent studies, and the size of the test set allows
identification of systematic problems with force field parameters for
particular classes of compounds. We believe that the computed free
energies and components will be valuable to others in future development
of force fields and solvation models.},

performance of biomolecular force fields and the quality of assigned
parameters. The AMOEBA polarizable force field moves beyond traditional
pairwise additive models of electrostatics and may be expected to improve
upon predictions of thermodynamic quantities such as HFEs over and above
fixed-point-charge models. The recent SAMPL4 challenge evaluated the
AMOEBA polarizable force field in this regard but showed substantially
worse results than those using the fixed-point-charge GAFF model. Starting
with a set of automatically generated AMOEBA parameters for the SAMPL4
data set, we evaluate the cumulative effects of a series of incremental
improvements in parametrization protocol, including both solute and
solvent model changes. Ultimately, the optimized AMOEBA parameters give a
set of results that are not statistically significantly different from
those of GAFF in terms of signed and unsigned error metrics. This allows
us to propose a number of guidelines for new molecule parameter derivation
with AMOEBA, which we expect to have benefits for a range of biomolecular
simulation applications such as protein{\textbackslash}textendashligand binding studies.},

applicable to database compounds were efficiently obtained. Based on the
same parameterization paradigm as used in the development of the COMPASS
force field, new parameters were derived by a combination of fits to
quantum mechanical data for valence parameters and experimental liquid and
crystal data for nonbond parameters. To preserve the quality of the
original COMPASS parameters, a quality assurance suite was used and
updated to ensure that additional atom-types and parameters do not
interfere with the existing ones. Validation against molecular properties,
liquid and crystal densities, and enthalpies, demonstrates that the
quality of COMPASS is preserved and the same quality of prediction is
achieved for the additional coverage.},

	abstract = {This article reports on the calibration and validation of a new
GROMOS-compatible parameter set 2016H66 for small organic molecules in the
condensed phase. The calibration is based on 62 organic molecules spanning
the chemical functions alcohol, ether, aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid,
ester, amine, amide, thiol, sulfide, and disulfide, as well as aromatic
compounds and nucleic-acid bases. For 57 organic compounds, the
calibration targets are the experimental pure-liquid density \${\textbackslash}rho\$liq and
the vaporization enthalpy \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Hvap, as well as the hydration free
energy \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gwat and the solvation free energy \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gche in
cyclohexane, at atmospheric pressure and at (or close to) room
temperature. The final root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) for these four
quantities over the set of compounds are 32.4 kg m{\textbackslash}textendash3, 3.5 kJ
mol{\textbackslash}textendash1, 4.1 kJ mol{\textbackslash}textendash1, and 2.1 kJ mol{\textbackslash}textendash1,
respectively, and the corresponding average deviations (AVED) are 1.0 kg
m{\textbackslash}textendash3, 0.2 kJ mol{\textbackslash}textendash1, 2.6 kJ mol{\textbackslash}textendash1, and 1.0 kJ
mol{\textbackslash}textendash1, respectively. For the five nucleic-acid bases, the
parametrization is performed by transferring the final 2016H66 parameters
from analogous organic compounds followed by a slight readjustment of the
charges to reproduce the experimental water-to-chloroform transfer free
energies \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gtrn. The final RMSD for this quantity over the five
bases is 1.7 kJ mol{\textbackslash}textendash1, and the corresponding AVED is 0.8 kJ
mol{\textbackslash}textendash1. As an initial validation of the 2016H66 set, seven
additional thermodynamic, transport, and dielectric properties are
calculated for the 57 organic compounds in the liquid phase. The agreement
with experiment in terms of these additional properties is found to be
reasonable, with significant deviations typically affecting either a
specific chemical function or a specific molecule. This suggests that in
most cases, a classical force-field description along with a careful
parametrization against \${\textbackslash}rho\$liq, \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Hvap, \${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gwat, and
\${\textbackslash}Delta\$Gche results in a model that appropriately describes the liquid in
terms of a wide spectrum of its physical properties.},

	abstract = {The stability of folded proteins is critical to their biological function
and for the efficacy of protein therapeutics. Predicting the energetic
effects of protein mutations can improve our fundamental understanding of
structural biology, the molecular basis of diseases, and possible routes
to addressing those diseases with biological drugs. Identifying the effect
of single amino acid point mutations on the thermodynamic equilibrium
between the folded and unfolded states of a protein can pinpoint residues
of critical importance that should be avoided in the process of improving
other properties (affinity, solubility, viscosity, etc.) and suggest
changes at other positions for increasing stability in protein
engineering. Multiple computational tools have been developed for in
silico predictions of protein stability in recent years, ranging from
sequence-based empirical approaches to rigorous physics-based free energy
methods. In this work, we show that FEP+, which is a free energy
perturbation method based on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, can
provide accurate thermal stability predictions for a wide range of
biologically relevant systems. Significantly, the FEP+ approach, while
originally developed for relative binding free energies of small molecules
to proteins and not specifically fitted for protein stability
calculations, performs well compared to other methods that were fitted
specifically to predict protein stability. Here, we present the broadest
validation of a rigorous free energy-based approach applied to protein
stability reported to date: 700+ single-point mutations spanning 10
different protein targets. Across the entire data set, we correctly
classify the mutations as stabilizing or destabilizing in 84\% of the
cases, and obtain statistically significant predictions as compared with
experiment [average error of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.6kcal/mol and coefficient of
determination (R2) of 0.40]. This study demonstrates, for the first time
in a large-scale validation, that rigorous free energy calculations can be
used to predict changes in protein stability from point mutations without
parameterization or system-specific customization, although further
improvements should be possible with additional sampling and a better
representation of the unfolded state of the protein. Here, we describe the
FEP+ method as applied to protein stability calculations, summarize the
large-scale retrospective validation results, and discuss limitations of
the method, along with future directions for further improvements.},

	abstract = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein{\textbackslash}textendashligand binding
affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for
decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery
process. However, computational methods have historically failed to
deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety
of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of
approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE)
calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and
statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate
predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises
from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods
(decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with
vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and
cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation
studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications
suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences
for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver
considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we
present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent
advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize
practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus
specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations
are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy
(ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead
optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies
between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used
to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of
running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives,
using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective
studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a
contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues
associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a
focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for
improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging
cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further
research in the field.},

these general force fields to an arbitrary drug-like molecule,
functionality for assignment of atom types, parameters, and partial atomic
charges is required. In the present article, algorithms for the assignment
of parameters and charges for the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) are
presented. These algorithms rely on the existing parameters and charges
that were determined as part of the parametrization of the force field.
Bonded parameters are assigned based on the similarity between the atom
types that define said parameters, while charges are determined using an
extended bond-charge increment scheme. Charge increments were optimized to
reproduce the charges on model compounds that were part of the
parametrization of the force field. A ``penalty score'' is returned for
every bonded parameter and charge, allowing the user to quickly and
conveniently assess the quality of the force field representation of
different parts of the compound of interest. Case studies are presented to

most commonly used at present, and it gives an indication of the
directions of current research that may yield better functions in the near
future. After a brief survey of current models, mostly generated during
the 1990s, the focus of the chapter is on the general directions the field
is taking in developing new models. The most commonly used protein force
fields incorporate a relatively simple potential energy function: The
emphasis is on the use of continuum methods to model the electrostatic
effects of hydration and the introduction of polarizability to model the
electronic response to changes in the environment. Some of the history and
performance of widely used protein force fields based on an equation on
simplest potential energy function or closely related equations are
reviewed. The chapter outlines some promising developments that go beyond
this, primarily by altering the way electrostatic interactions are
treated. The use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge distributions,
as well as attempts to incorporate electronic polarizability, are also
discussed in the chapter.},

	abstract = {The ff94 force field that is commonly associated with the Amber simulation
package is one of the most widely used parameter sets for biomolecular
simulation. After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in
this force field, such as over-stabilization of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-helices, were
reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to
improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of ``Amber'' force fields
and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a
particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer
from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In
addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account
for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone \${\textbackslash}varphi\$/\${\textbackslash}psi\$
dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable
conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to
improve the \${\textbackslash}varphi\$/\${\textbackslash}psi\$ dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function.
Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple
conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab
initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone
dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter
set, which we denote ff99SB, achieves a better balance of secondary
structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone
dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to PDB survey data. It also
accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for
conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord
with experimental NMR relaxation data of test protein systems. Proteins

structure with a bound ligand (indinavir) was chosen as a model
protein-ligand complex. The complex was decomposed into 21 interacting
fragment pairs, which were studied using a number of computational
methods. The chemically accurate complete basis set coupled cluster theory

generate our error estimates. In our analysis, we observed significant
systematic and random errors in most methods, which was surprising,
especially for parametrized classical and semiempirical quantum mechanical
calculations. After propagating these fragment-based error estimates over
the entire protein-ligand complex, our total error estimates for many
methods are large compared to the experimentally determined free energy of
binding. Thus, we conclude that statistical error analysis is a necessary
addition to any scoring function attempting to produce reliable binding

an extensive revision of a widely used RNA force field in which the

fundamental forces that stabilize RNA structures. We evaluate these
revised parameters through long-timescale MD simulations of a set of RNA
molecules that covers a wide range of structural complexity, including
single-stranded RNAs, RNA duplexes, RNA hairpins, and riboswitches. The
structural and thermodynamic properties measured in these simulations
exhibited dramatically improved agreement with experimentally determined

appears to achieve a level of accuracy comparable to that of

task. Forcefields can contain tens or hundreds of different types of the
same element, where each type represents the element in a different

scarce and unstructured, commonly expressed in plain text or in an ad-hoc
shorthand notation, leading to ambiguities and increasing the likelihood
of incorrect usage. While there are freely available tools to aid in
atom-typing, these are typically specific to a particular forcefield or
simulator and capture the atom-typing and parameterization rules in ways
that are hard to maintain, debug, and evolve. This work proposes to
establish a formalism to express the chemical context for which a
particular forcefield parameter is applicable (i.e., forcefield usage
semantics) and an atom-typing tool that interprets this formalism to
generate forcefield parameterizations that are provably correct.},

complete refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which had
been carried over from ff94. The training set of conformations included
multidimensional dihedral scans designed to improve transferability of the
parameters. Improvement in all amino acids was obtained as compared to
ff99SB. Parameters were also generated for alternate protonation states of
ionizable side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of
conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced 35\% from
ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical adjustments to the
protein backbone dihedral parameters as compared to ff99SB. Multiple small
adjustments of \${\textbackslash}varphi\$ and \${\textbackslash}psi\$ parameters were tested against NMR
scalar coupling data and secondary structure content for short peptides.
The best results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to
the \${\textbackslash}varphi\$ rotational profile that compensates for lack of ff99SB QM
training data in the \${\textbackslash}beta\$-ppII transition region. Together, these
backbone and side chain modifications (hereafter called ff14SB) not only
better reproduced their benchmarks, but also improved secondary structure

prerequisite for meaningful results from such simulations is an accurate
molecular mechanical force field. Most biomolecular simulations are
currently based on the widely used AMBER and CHARMM force fields, which
were parametrized and optimized to cover a small set of basic compounds
corresponding to the natural amino acids and nucleic acid bases. Atomic
models of additional compounds are commonly generated by analogy to the
parameter set of a given force field. While this procedure yields models
that are internally consistent, the accuracy of the resulting models can
be limited. In this work, we propose a method, general automated atomic
model parameterization (GAAMP), for generating automatically the
parameters of atomic models of small molecules using the results from ab
initio quantum mechanical (QM) calculations as target data. Force fields
that were previously developed for a wide range of model compounds serve
as initial guesses, although any of the final parameter can be optimized.
The electrostatic parameters (partial charges, polarizabilities, and
shielding) are optimized on the basis of QM electrostatic potential (ESP)
and, if applicable, the interaction energies between the compound and
water molecules. The soft dihedrals are automatically identified and
parametrized by targeting QM dihedral scans as well as the energies of

	abstract = {We present results of improving the OPLS-AA force field for peptides by
means of refitting the key Fourier torsional coefficients. The fitting
technique combines using accurate ab initio data as the target, choosing
an efficient fitting subspace of the whole potential-energy surface, and
determining weights for each of the fitting points based on magnitudes of
the potential-energy gradient. The average energy RMS deviation from the
LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)//HF/6-31G** data is reduced by ca. 40\% from 0.81 to 0.47
kcal/mol as a result of the fitting for the electrostatically uncharged
dipeptides. Transferability of the parameters is demonstrated by using the
same alanine dipeptide-fitted backbone torsional parameters for all of the
other dipeptides (with the appropriate side-chain refitting) and the
alanine tetrapeptide. Parameters of nonbonded interactions have also been
refitted for the sulfur-containing dipeptides (cysteine and methionine),
and the validity of the new Coulombic charges and the van der Waals
\${\textbackslash}sigma\$'s and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$'s is proved through reproducing gas-phase
energies of complex formation heats of vaporization and densities of pure
model liquids. Moreover, a novel approach to fitting torsional parameters
for electrostatically charged molecular systems has been presented and
successfully tested on five dipeptides with charged side chains.},

procedure, which becomes impractical as the coverage of the force field

scheme is proposed to make extensible atom type definitions, which ensures
that the force field developed based on the definitions are extensible. To
demonstrate how HAD works and to prepare a foundation for future
developments, two general force fields based on AMBER and DFF functional
forms are parameterized for common organic molecules. The force field
parameters are derived from the same set of quantum mechanical data and
experimental liquid data using an automated parameterization tool, and
validated by calculating molecular and liquid properties. The hydration
free energies are calculated successfully by introducing a polarization
scaling factor to the dispersion term between the solvent and solute

	abstract = {In molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations, the interactions between
the particles (atoms) in the system are described by a so-called force
field. The empirical functional form of classical fixed-charge force
fields dates back to 1969 and remains essentially unchanged. In a
fixed-charge force field, the polarization is not modeled explicitly, i.e.
the effective partial charges do not change depending on conformation and
environment. This simplification allows, however, a dramatic reduction in
computational cost compared to polarizable force fields and in particular
quantum-chemical modeling. The past decades have shown that simulations
employing carefully parametrized fixed-charge force fields can provide
useful insights into biological and chemical questions. This overview
focuses on the four major force-field families, i.e. AMBER, CHARMM,
GROMOS, and OPLS, which are based on the same classical functional form
and are continuously improved to the present day. The overview is aimed at
readers entering the field of (bio)molecular simulations. More experienced
users may find the comparison and historical development of the
force-field families interesting.},

	abstract = {Forcefields are a crucial ingredient of Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations, describing the types and parameters of interactions between
the simulated particles. These parameter sets, however, are typically
specific to the molecule in which the atoms appears, where within the

as well as the simulator tool in use. This makes choosing the correct
parameter values a tedious and error prone task. Forcefield parameters,
furthermore, are often hard to locate: some are published in scientific
papers, others come with MD tools, often with no or ambiguous
documentation on their applicability. In this paper, we present a
framework that aims to solve this data management issue, proposing a
common format for forcefields that is self-documenting with machine
readable, declarative usage rules. We believe that processes and tools
that are commonly used today in software development (e.g, unit testing,
verification and validation, continuous integration, and version control)
are, with proper infrastructure support, applicable to forcefield
development, as well. The paper describes how such an infrastructure can
tackle managing and evolving forcefields by the MD community, and proposes
a way to encourage and incentivize involvement by the stakeholders.},

parameters build upon those for related molecules (e.g., ethers and
perfluoroalkanes) in the OPLS-AA force field, with new parameters
introduced for interactions specific to PFPEs. Molecular dynamics
simulations using the new force field demonstrate excellent agreement with
ab initio calculations at the RHF/6-31G* level for gas-phase torsional
energies (\${\textless}\$0.5 kcal mol{\textbackslash}textendash1 error) and molecular structures for

densities (\${\textless}\$0.02 g cm{\textbackslash}textendash3 error) and enthalpies of vaporization

Additional comparisons between experiment and simulation show that
polyethers demonstrate a significant decrease in enthalpy of vaporization
upon fluorination unlike related molecules (e.g., alkanes and alcohols).
Simulation suggests this phenomenon is a result of reduced cohesion in
liquid PFPEs due to a reduction in localized associations between backbone
oxygen atoms and neighboring molecules.},

	abstract = {Here, we focus on testing and improving force fields for molecular
modeling, which see widespread use in diverse areas of computational
chemistry and biomolecular simulation. A key issue affecting the accuracy
and transferrability of these force fields is the use of atom typing.
Traditional approaches to defining molecular mechanics force fields must
encode, within a discrete set of atom types, all information which will
ever be needed about the chemical environment; parameters are then
assigned by looking up combinations of these atom types in tables. This
atom typing approach leads to a wide variety of problems such as
inextensible atom-typing machinery, enormous difficulty in expanding
parameters encoded by atom types, and unnecessarily proliferation of
encoded parameters. Here, we describe a new approach to assigning
parameters for molecular mechanics force fields based on the industry
standard SMARTS chemical perception language (with extensions to identify
specific atoms available in SMIRKS). In this approach, each force field
term (bonds, angles, and torsions, and nonbonded interactions) features
separate definitions assigned in a hierarchical manner without using atom
types. We accomplish this using direct chemical perception, where
parameters are assigned directly based on substructure queries operating
on the molecule(s) being parameterized, thereby avoiding the intermediate
step of assigning atom types --- a step which can be considered indirect
chemical perception. Direct chemical perception allows for substantial
simplification of force fields, as well as additional generality in the
substructure queries. This approach is applicable to a wide variety of
(bio)molecular systems, and can greatly reduce the number of parameters
needed to create a complete force field. Further flexibility can also be
gained by allowing force field terms to be interpolated based on the
assignment of fractional bond orders via the same procedure used to assign
partial charges. As an example of the utility of this approach, we provide
a minimalist small molecule force field derived from Merck's parm@Frosst
(an Amber parm99 descendant), in which a parameter definition file only
approximately 300 lines long can parameterize a large and diverse spectrum
of pharmaceutically relevant small molecule chemical space. We benchmark
this minimalist force field on the FreeSolv small molecule hydration free
energy set and calculations of densities and dielectric constants from the
ThermoML Archive, demonstrating that it achieves comparable accuracy to
the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) that consists of many thousands
of parameters.},

	abstract = {Small organic molecules are often flexible, i.e., they can adopt a variety
of low-energy conformations in solution that exist in equilibrium with
each other. Two main search strategies are used to generate representative
conformational ensembles for molecules: systematic and stochastic. In the
first approach, each rotatable bond is sampled systematically in discrete
intervals, limiting its use to molecules with a small number of rotatable
bonds. Stochastic methods, on the other hand, sample the conformational
space of a molecule randomly and can thus be applied to more flexible
molecules. Different methods employ different degrees of experimental data
for conformer generation. So-called knowledge-based methods use predefined
libraries of torsional angles and ring conformations. In the distance
geometry approach, on the other hand, a smaller amount of empirical
information is used, i.e., ideal bond lengths, ideal bond angles, and a
few ideal torsional angles. Distance geometry is a computationally fast
method to generate conformers, but it has the downside that purely
distance-based constraints tend to lead to distorted aromatic rings and
sp2 centers. To correct this, the resulting conformations are often
minimized with a force field, adding computational complexity and run
time. Here we present an alternative strategy that combines the distance
geometry approach with experimental torsion-angle preferences obtained
from small-molecule crystallographic data. The torsional angles are
described by a previously developed set of hierarchically structured
SMARTS patterns. The new approach is implemented in the open-source
cheminformatics library RDKit, and its performance is assessed by
comparing the diversity of the generated ensemble and the ability to
reproduce crystal conformations taken from the crystal structures of small
molecules and protein{\textbackslash}textendashligand complexes.},

potentials for the solid and for a single ASA molecule using the Einstein
Molecule Method required an extremely large number of intermediate states
for the free energy calculations, meaning that the calculations were
extremely demanding computationally.Despite the computational cost,
however, the computed value did not agree well with experiment,
potentially due to limitations with the underlying energy model.Perhaps
better values could be obtained with a better energy model; however, it
seems likely computational cost may remain a limiting factor for use of
this particular approach to solubility estimation. Conclusions.Solubility
prediction of drug-like solids still is a challenge on the computational

	abstract = {From molecular dynamics simulations of a dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline
(DPPC) lipid bilayer in the liquid crystalline phase, pressure profiles
through the bilayer are calculated by different methods. These profiles
allow us to address two central and unresolved problems in pressure
profile calculations: The first problem is that the pressure profile is
not uniquely defined since the expression for the local pressure involves
an arbitrary choice of an integration contour. We have investigated two
different choices leading to the Irving-Kirkwood (IK) and Harasima (H)
expressions for the local pressure tensor. For these choices we find that
the pressure profile is almost independent of the contour used, which
indicates that the local pressure is well defined for a DPPC bilayer in
the liquid crystalline phase. This may not be the case for other systems
and we therefore suggest that both the IK and H profiles are calculated in
order to test the uniqueness of the profile. The second problem is how to
include electrostatic interactions in pressure profile calculations when
the simulations are conducted without truncating the electrostatic
potential, i.e., using the Ewald summation technique. Based on the H
expression for the local pressure, we present a method for calculating the
contribution to the lateral components of the local pressure tensor from
electrostatic interactions evaluated by the Ewald summation technique.
Pressure profiles calculated with an electrostatic potential truncation
(cutoff) from simulations conducted with Ewald summation are shown to
depend on the cutoff in a subtle manner which is attributed to the
existence of long-ranged charge ordering in the system. However, the
pressure profiles calculated with relatively long cutoffs are
qualitatively similar to the Ewald profile for the DPPC bilayer studied
here.},

involved in membrane remodeling in various cellular pathways ranging from
endocytic vesicle and T-tubule formation to cell migration and
neuromorphogenesis. Membrane curvature induction and stabilization are
encoded within the BAR or Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) domains,
alpha-helical coiled coils that dimerize into membrane-binding modules.
BAR/F-BAR domain proteins often contain an SH3 domain, which recruits
binding partners such as the oligomeric membrane-fissioning GTPase
dynamin. How precisely BAR/F-BAR domain-mediated membrane deformation is
regulated at the cellular level is unknown. Here we present the crystal
structures of full-length syndapin 1 and its F-BAR domain. Our data show
that syndapin 1 F-BAR-mediated membrane deformation is subject to
autoinhibition by its SH3 domain. Release from the clamped conformation is
driven by association of syndapin 1 SH3 with the proline-rich domain of
dynamin 1, thereby unlocking its potent membrane-bending activity. We
hypothesize that this mechanism might be commonly used to regulate
BAR/F-BAR domain-induced membrane deformation and to potentially couple
this process to dynamin-mediated fission. Our data thus suggest a
structure-based model for SH3-mediated regulation of BAR/F-BAR domain

modulating protein stability, with proteins that are adapted to extreme
cold environments having increased conformational flexibility when brought
to mesophilic conditions. Conversely, proteins adapted to higher
temperatures appear less dynamic and are found to be much more stable
against thermal denaturation than their mesophilic counterparts. According
to the current paradigm, the adaptation of an organism for survival at
higher or lower temperatures is facilitated by the adaptation of the
component proteins. We note, however, that these observations have been
carried out on relatively few proteins. The extent to which the
conformational stabilities of all members of the proteome have been
modulated for thermal adaptation remains unclear, with no direct
experimental strategies to address this issue. Adapted extremophilies are
likely to use a multitude of molecular and biophysical strategies for
survival and, therefore, evolution of specific biophysical properties of
proteins for optimal function may not be necessary for all proteins in the
proteome. Using a sequence-based predictor of protein stability, eScape,
an in silico examination of several extremophilic proteomes shows a
correlation between the collective stability of the proteins and the
thermal range of survival for the organism as expected. Unexpectedly,
however, the analysis shows that protein thermostability is modified to
different extents across the proteome and depends on the functional role
for which the protein is involved. Identification of these differences
provides unique opportunities to study interdependence within the proteome

	abstract = {In striated muscles, invaginations from the plasma membrane, termed
transverse tubules (T-tubule), function in the excitation-contraction
coupling machinery. BIN1 (isoform8) plays a critical role in the
biogenesis of T-tubules. BIN1 contains an N-terminal BAR domain to sense
and induce membrane curvature, an isoform8-specific polybasic motif
(exon10) as the phosphoinositide binding module and a C-terminal Src
homology 3 (SH3) domain for the recruitment of downstream proteins such as
dynamin 2. Previous studies of N-BAR domains focused on elucidating
mechanisms of membrane curvature sensing and generation (MC-S\&G). Less is
known about how MC-S\&G is regulated. We found that the SH3 domain binds to
the exon10 motif more strongly compared to the proline-rich domain (PRD)
of dynamin 2. Furthermore, we found that the MC-S\&G ability of full-length
BIN1 is inhibited on membranes lacking PI(4,5)P2. Addition of PI(4,5)P2 in
the membrane activates BIN1 to sense and induce membrane curvature.
Co-presence of the SH3 domain and exon10 motif leads to the strongest
phosphoinositide-mediated control of BIN1 function. Addition of SH3 domain
ligand (such as PRD peptides), as well as addition of the water-soluble
PI(4,5)P2 analogue, can both enhance the MC-S\&G ability of BIN1 on
membranes without PI(4,5)P2, indicating that the key to activate BIN1 is
to disrupt the exon10-SH3 interaction. The nonsense mutation K436X, found
in centronuclear myopathy (CNM) patients, abolishes SH3 domain binding
with either exon10 or the PRD motif, resulting in increased membrane
deformation capacity. Our results suggest an autoinhibition model for BIN1
that involves a synergistic regulation by membrane composition and
protein-protein interactions.},

While it has been argued that continuum models cannot reproduce the

lines with our hybrid continuum-atomistic model, and we show the model is
in excellent agreement with fully-atomistic simulations of the nhTMEM16

N-BAR domains) for generating membrane curvature. These experiments
suggest that curvature is generated by the synergistic action of the
N-terminal helices embedding in the lipid bilayer and the charged
crescent-shaped dimer acting to "scaffold" membrane curvature. Here, we
present atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that directly show
membrane binding to the concave face of N-BAR domains, resulting in the
generation of local membrane curvature that matches the curvature
presented by the BAR domain. These simulations provide direct
molecular-scale evidence that BAR domains create curvature by acting as a
scaffold, forcing the membrane to locally adopt the intrinsic shape of the
BAR domain. We find that BAR domains bind strongly through the maximum
curvature surface and, additionally, at an orientation that presents a
lesser degree of curvature, thus enabling N-BAR domains to induce a range
of local curvatures. Finally, we find that the N-terminal region may play
a role in biasing the orientations of N-BAR domains on the membrane
surface to those that favor binding to the concave face and subsequent
membrane bending.},

Also, Bax molecules populated the walls of both small and large pores at
the same density, implying that Bax is continuously recruited to the pores

protein aggregation. Continuum elastic models of the membrane have been
widely used to study protein-membrane interactions. These mathematical
approaches produce physically interpretable membrane shapes, energy
estimates for the cost of deformation, and a snapshot of the equilibrium
configuration. Moreover, elastic models are much less computationally
demanding than fully atomistic and coarse-grained simulation

excellent agreement with fully atomistic simulations of the ion channel

membrane protrusions. Their anatomy, stability and density are intimately
linked to cognitive performance. The morphological transitions of spines
are powered by coordinated polymerization of actin filaments against the

discuss our recent findings showing that dendritic spines can be initiated
by direct membrane bending by the I-BAR protein MIM/Mtss1. This lipid
phosphatidylinositol (PI(4,5)P2) signaling-activated membrane bending
coordinated spatial actin assembly and promoted spine formation. From

concentrated protein-lipid microdomains formed by multivalent interactions
between lipids and actin/membrane regulatory proteins might launch cell

	abstract = {We investigate finite-size effects on diffusion in confined fluids using
molecular dynamics simulations and hydrodynamic calculations.
Specifically, we consider a Lennard-Jones fluid in slit pores without slip
at the interface and show that the use of periodic boundary conditions in
the directions along the surfaces results in dramatic finite-size effects,
in addition to that of the physically relevant confining length. As in the
simulation of bulk fluids, these effects arise from spurious hydrodynamic
interactions between periodic images and from the constraint of total
momentum conservation. We derive analytical expressions for the correction
to the diffusion coefficient in the limits of both elongated and flat
systems, which are in excellent agreement with the molecular simulation
results except for the narrowest pores, where the discreteness of the
fluid particles starts to play a role. The present work implies that the
diffusion coefficients for wide nanopores computed using elongated boxes
suffer from finite-size artifacts which had not been previously
appreciated. In addition, our analytical expression provides the
correction to be applied to the simulation results for finite (possibly
small) systems. It applies not only to molecular but also to all
mesoscopic hydrodynamic simulations, including Lattice-Boltzmann,
Multiparticle Collision Dynamics or Dissipative Particle Dynamics, which
are often used to investigate confined soft matter involving colloidal

α-Synuclein, the principal member of this family, is mutated in familial

synaptic protein changes in αβγ-synuclein knock-out brains. We observed
increases in the levels of select membrane curvature sensing/generating

endophilin A1. Here we demonstrate that the levels of synucleins and
endophilin A1 are reciprocally regulated and that they are functionally

curvature similar to endophilins. However, only monomeric but not
tetrameric α-synuclein can bend membranes. Further, A30P α-synuclein, a
Parkinson disease mutant that disrupts protein folding, is also deficient
in this activity. This suggests that synucleins generate membrane
curvature through the asymmetric insertion of their N-terminal amphipathic

approach for quantifying the hydrophobic mismatch-driven remodeling of
membrane bilayers by multihelical membrane proteins. The method accounts
for both the membrane remodeling energy and the energy contribution from

membrane remodeling. Overcoming previous limitations, it allows for
radially asymmetric bilayer deformations produced by multihelical

coupled receptors: rhodopsin in bilayers of different thickness, and the
serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor bound to pharmacologically different ligands.
Analysis of the results identifies the residual exposure that is not
alleviated by bilayer adaptation, and its quantification at specific

we studied the interaction of calcium ions with membrane tethers pulled

the proposed atomic structure. Surprisingly, this effect vanishes in the

associated with these conformational changes are either ignored or assumed
to be included by virtue of the sampling performed in the calculation.
Here, we show that, in a model protein system (a designed binding site in
T4 Lysozyme), conformational changes can make a difference of several
kcal/mol in computed binding free energies, and that they are neglected in
computed binding free energies if the system remains kinetically trapped
in a particular metastable state on simulation timescales. We introduce a
general "confine-and-release" framework for free energy calculations that
accounts for these free energies of conformational change. We illustrate
its use in this model system by demonstrating that an umbrella sampling

	abstract = {The energetics of protein-induced bilayer deformation in systems with
finite monolayer equilibrium curvature were investigated using an elastic
membrane model. In this model the bilayer deformation energy delta G(def)
has two major components: a compression-expansion component and a
splay-distortion component, which includes the consequences of a bilayer
curvature frustration due to a monolayer equilibrium curvature, c(0), that
is different from zero. For any choice of bilayer material constants, the
value of delta G(def) depends on global bilayer properties, as described
by the bilayer material constants, as well as the energetics of local
lipid packing adjacent to the protein. We introduce this dependence on
lipid packing through the contact slope, s, at the protein-bilayer
boundary. When c(0) = 0, delta G(def) can be approximated as a biquadratic
function of s and the monolayer deformation at the protein/bilayer
boundary, u(0): delta G(def) = a(1)u(0)(2) + a(2)u(0)s + a(3)s(2), where
a(1), a(2), and a(3) are functions of the bilayer thickness, the bilayer
compression-expansion and splay-distortion moduli, and the inclusion
radius (this expression becomes exact when the Gaussian curvature
component of delta G(def) is negligible). When c(0) not equal 0, the
curvature frustration contribution is determined by the choice of boundary
conditions at the protein-lipid boundary (by the value of s), and delta
G(def) is the sum of the energy for c(0) = 0 plus the curvature
frustration-dependent contribution. When the energetic penalty for the
local lipid packing can be ignored, delta G(def) will be determined only
by the global bilayer properties, and a c(0) {\textgreater} 0 will tend to promote a
local inclusion-induced bilayer thinning. When the energetic penalty for
local lipid packing is large, s will be constrained by the value of c(0).
In a limiting case, where s is determined only by geometric constraints
imposed by c(0), a c(0) {\textgreater} 0 will impede such local bilayer thinning. One
cannot predict curvature effects without addressing the proper choice of
boundary conditions at the protein-bilayer contact surface.},

deformations produce defects in the geometrical arrangement of lipids,
thus allowing the adsorption of certain peripheral proteins. Here, we
perform molecular dynamics simulations on bilayers containing a
cylindrical lipid (PC) and a conical lipid (DOG). Profiles of atomic
density and lateral pressure across the bilayer show differences in the
acyl chain region due to deeper partitioning of DOG compared to PC.
However, such analyses are less informative for the interfacial region
where peripheral proteins adsorb. To circumvent this limitation, we
develop, to our knowledge, a new method of membrane surface analysis. This
method allows the identification of chemical defects, where hydrocarbon
chains are accessible to the solvent, and geometrical defects, i.e., voids
deeper than the glycerol backbone. The size and number of both types of
defects increase with the number of monounsaturated acyl chains in PC and

enormous diversity of sphingolipid classes and molecular species. The
intrinsic properties of sphingolipids are not only suited for
orchestrating lateral architectures of biological membranes, but their
molecular distinctions also allow for the evolution of protein motifs
specifically recognising and interacting with individual lipids. Although
various reports suggest a role of sphingolipids in membrane protein
function, only a few cases have determined the specificity of these
interactions. In this review we discuss examples of specific
protein-sphingolipid interactions for which a modulator-like dependency on
sphingolipids was assigned to specific proteins. These novel functions of
sphingolipids in specific protein-lipid assemblies contribute to the

explain why micrometer-scale membrane domains are observed in isolated,
cytoskeleton-free giant plasma membrane vesicles, but not in intact cell

of this highly bent protein, we employed molecular dynamics simulations to
fit an all-atom structural model of the RC-LH1-PufX dimer within the

produces a membrane with high local curvature, even though the location of
PufX cannot yet be determined uniquely. The resulting membrane curvature
agrees well with the size of RC-LH1-PufX tubular vesicles, and
demonstrates how the local curvature properties of the RC-LH1-PufX dimer

strategy to model large systems by partitioning energies into a hierarchy
of decreasingly significant contributions. The number of calculations
required for chemical accuracy is still prohibitively expensive for the ab
initio MBE to compete with force field approximations for applications
beyond single-point energies. Alongside the MBE, empirical models of ab
initio potential energy surfaces have improved, especially non-linear
models based on neural networks (NNs) which can reproduce ab initio
potential energy surfaces rapidly and accurately. Although they are fast,
NNs suffer from their own curse of dimensionality; they must be trained on
a representative sample of chemical space. In this paper we examine the
synergy of the MBE and NN's and explore their complementarity. The MBE
offers a systematic way to treat systems of arbitrary size while reducing
the scaling problem of large systems. NN's reduce, by a factor in excess
of 106, the computational overhead of the MBE and reproduce the accuracy
of ab initio calculations without specialized force fields. We show that
for a small molecule extended system like methanol, accuracy can be
achieved with drastically different chemical embeddings. To assess this we
test a new chemical embedding which can be inverted to predict molecules
with desired properties. We also provide our open-source code for the

	abstract = {The paradigm of biological membranes has recently gone through a major
update. Instead of being fluid and homogeneous, recent studies suggest
that membranes are characterized by transient domains with varying
fluidity. In particular, a number of experimental studies have revealed
the existence of highly ordered lateral domains rich in sphingomyelin and
cholesterol (CHOL). These domains, called functional lipid rafts, have
been suggested to take part in a variety of dynamic cellular processes
such as membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and regulation of the
activity of membrane proteins. However, despite the proposed importance of
these domains, their properties, and even the precise nature of the lipid
phases, have remained open issues mainly because the associated short time
and length scales have posed a major challenge to experiments. In this
work, we employ extensive atom-scale simulations to elucidate the
properties of ternary raft mixtures with CHOL, palmitoylsphingomyelin
(PSM), and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine. We simulate two bilayers of
1,024 lipids for 100 ns in the liquid-ordered phase and one system of the
same size in the liquid-disordered phase. The studies provide evidence
that the presence of PSM and CHOL in raft-like membranes leads to strongly
packed and rigid bilayers. We also find that the simulated raft bilayers
are characterized by nanoscale lateral heterogeneity, though the slow
lateral diffusion renders the interpretation of the observed lateral
heterogeneity more difficult. The findings reveal aspects of the role of
favored (specific) lipid-lipid interactions within rafts and clarify the
prominent role of CHOL in altering the properties of the membrane locally
in its neighborhood. Also, we show that the presence of PSM and CHOL in
rafts leads to intriguing lateral pressure profiles that are distinctly
different from corresponding profiles in nonraft-like membranes. The
results propose that the functioning of certain classes of membrane
proteins is regulated by changes in the lateral pressure profile, which
can be altered by a change in lipid content.},

implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It contains a
Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs membrane-binding domain with an N-terminal amphipathic
helix that senses and generates membrane curvature. However, an
understanding of the parameters distinguishing these two functions is
missing. By pulling a highly curved nanotube of controlled radius from a
giant vesicle in a solution containing amphiphysin, we observed that the
action of the protein depends directly on its density on the membrane. At
low densities of protein on the nearly flat vesicle, the distribution of
proteins and the mechanical effects induced are described by a model based
on spontaneous curvature induction. The tube radius and force are modified
by protein binding but still depend on membrane tension. In the dilute
limit, when practically no proteins were present on the vesicle, no
mechanical effects were detected, but strong protein enrichment
proportional to curvature was seen on the tube. At high densities, the
radius is independent of tension and vesicle protein density, resulting
from the formation of a scaffold around the tube. As a consequence, the
scaling of the force with tension is modified. For the entire density
range, protein was enriched on the tube as compared to the vesicle. Our
approach shows that the strength of curvature sensing and mechanical

D2O hydrated bilayers with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
provides a unique tool for characterization of the hydrogen bonding at the
acylgroup level of lipid bilayers. In this work, we use this approach to
study the influence of fluoride anions on the properties of cationic
bilayers composed of trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP). The results
obtained for DOTAP are confronted with those for neutral
phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers. Both in DOTAP and DOPC H2O/D2O
exchange prolongs hydrogen-bonding lifetime and does not disturb bilayer
structure. These results are confirmed by MD simulations. TDFS experiments
show, however, that for DOTAP this effect is cancelled in the presence of
fluoride ions. We interpret these results as evidence that strongly
hydrated fluoride is able to steal water molecules that bridge lipid
carbonyls. Consequently, when attracted to DOTAP bilayer, fluoride
disrupts the local hydrogen-bonding network, and the differences in TDFS
kinetics between H2O and D2O hydrated bilayers are no longer observed. A
distinct behavior of fluoride is also evidenced by MD simulations, which
show different lipid-ion binding for Cl(-) and F(-).},

demonstrates that a calcium ion gradient, applied to a synthetic lipid

translated in a contactless manner by moving a calcium ion source along

transporting of the nanoparticle cargo along the lipid nanotube. In
addition to the synthetic lipid nanotubes, the response of cell plasma

kinetics in comparison to the synthetic lipid nanotubes. The findings of
this work demonstrate a novel and contactless mode of transport in lipid

WALP23 helices embedded in different lipid bilayers indicate no barrier of
association and a stabilization of more than 20 kJ mol(-1) of the
associated state relative to the fully dissociated state. Association is
strongest in DMPC, followed by DPPC and DOPC. Helix-helix association
appears to be enthalpically favorable in all lipid bilayers, while the
entropic contribution appears favorable only in the presence of
significant positive hydrophobic mismatch, in DMPC lipids. The
interpretation of this requires care given the coarse-grained nature of
the simulations, but the sign of the thermodynamic quantities agrees with
experimental measurements on dimerization of (AALALAA)3 peptides and the
observed association free energies are within the experimental range. Both
protein-protein and lipid-lipid interactions appear to strongly favor
protein dimerization, while the interactions between a dimer and lipid are
unfavorable relative to the interactions between two separated monomers
and lipids. Dimers with antiparallel orientation appear to be
thermodynamically favored over parallel dimers, particularly in conditions
of greater hydrophobic mismatch, but elucidating the detailed origin of
this likely requires simulations of helices for which there is structural
data on the dimer. We analyze 3D density, membrane order, and membrane
thickness maps using new freely available analysis programs. Although
these properties differ somewhat for each lipid, perturbations extend to
about 1 nm for lipid density, {\textasciitilde}2 nm for ordering and {\textasciitilde}2.5 nm for

to clarify to what extent this mechanism is exploited by endocytic

generation by means of a GUV shape stability assay. We found that the

with membrane tension. Importantly, we also revealed that at the same
membrane tension, the crowding mechanism requires far higher protein
coverage to induce curvature changes compared to those observed for the

that it accurately predicts PIP3 regulation. Strikingly, this algorithm
showed that PIP3 regulation is specified by amino acids across the PH

our algorithm and live-cell experiments provide a functional survey of PH

toward structure-function relationships and material design. In the
context of computer simulations, progress is hampered by both the sheer
number of compounds and the efforts associated with parametrizing a force

provides not only a reduced phase space but also a smaller number of
compounds, due to the redundancy of CG representations mapping to the same
structure. Though many CG models require the explicit force-field
parametrization of a molecule with all others, others assume
transferability by means of mixing rules, such as the Martini force field.
To alleviate the burden associated with tedious parametrizations for each
new compound, the present work aims at automating the mapping and
parametrization of common small organic molecules for Martini. We test the
method by analyzing the water/octanol partitioning of more than 650
neutral molecules, the hydration free energy of 354 others, and the free
energies of hydration and solvation in octanol of another 69 compounds.
Last, we compare with all-atom simulations the thermodynamics of insertion

formation of highly curved spherical or cylindrical membranes. How a
protein induces these different types of membrane curvature and how cells
regulate this process is still unclear. Endophilin A1 is a protein
involved in generating endocytotic necks and vesicles during synaptic
endocytosis and can transform large vesicles into lipid tubes or small and
highly curved vesicles in vitro. By using EM and electron paramagnetic
resonance of endophilin A1, we find that tubes are formed by a close
interaction with endophilin A1's BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain and deep
insertion of its amphipathic helices. In contrast, vesicles are
predominantly stabilized by the shallow insertion of the amphipathic
helical wedges with the BAR domain removed from the membrane. By showing
that the mechanism of membrane curvature induction is different for
vesiculation and tubulation, these data also explain why previous studies
arrived at different conclusions with respect to the importance of
scaffolding and wedging in the membrane curvature generation of BAR
proteins. The Parkinson disease-associated kinase LRRK2 phosphorylates S75
of endophilin A1, a position located in the acyl chain region on tubes and
the aqueous environment on vesicles. We find that the phosphomimetic
mutation S75D favors vesicle formation by inhibiting this conformational
switch, acting to regulate endophilin A1-mediated curvature. As endophilin
A1 is part of a protein superfamily, we expect these mechanisms and their
regulation by posttranslational modifications to be a general means for
controlling different types of membrane curvature in a wide range of

target curved membranes. This behavior is believed to have functional
significance in a number of essential pathways, such as clathrin-mediated
endocytosis, which involve dramatic membrane remodeling and require the
recruitment of various cofactors at different stages of the process. This
work is motivated in part by recent experiments that demonstrated that the
amphipathic N-terminal helix of endophilin (H0) targets curved membranes
by binding to hydrophobic lipid bilayer packing defects which increase in
number with increasing membrane curvature. Here we use state-of-the-art
atomistic simulation to explore the packing defect structure of curved
membranes, and the effect of this structure on the folding of H0. We find
that not only are packing defects increased in number with increasing
membrane curvature, but also that their size distribution depends
nontrivially on the curvature, falling off exponentially with a decay
constant that depends on the curvature, and crucially that even on highly
curved membranes defects large enough to accommodate the hydrophobic face
of H0 are never observed. We furthermore find that a percolation model for
the defects explains the defect size distribution, which implies that
larger defects are formed by coalescence of noninteracting smaller
defects. We also use the recently developed metadynamics algorithm to
study in detail the effect of such defects on H0 folding. It is found that
the comparatively larger defects found on a convex membrane promote H0
folding by several kcal/mol, while the smaller defects found on flat and
concave membrane surfaces inhibit folding by kinetically trapping the
peptide. Together, these observations suggest H0 folding is a cooperative
process in which the folding peptide changes the defect structure relative
to an unperturbed membrane.},

messengers, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, but
also in modulating a variety of cellular functions including cytoskeletal
organization and membrane trafficking. Many inositol lipid kinases and
phosphatases appear to regulate the concentration of a variety of
phosphoinositides in a specific area, thereby inducing spatial and
temporal changes in their availability. For example, local concentration
changes in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) in response
to extracellular stimuli cause the reorganization of actin filaments and a
change in cell shape. PI(4,5)P(2) uncaps the barbed end of actin filaments
and increases actin nucleation by modulating a variety of actin regulatory
proteins, leading to de novo actin polymerization. PI(4,5)P(2) also plays
a key role in membrane trafficking processes. In endocytosis, PI(4,5)P(2)
targets clathrin-associated proteins to endocytic vesicles, leading to
clathrin-coated pit formation. On the contrary, PI(4,5)P(2) must be
dephosphorylated when they shed clathrin coats to fuse endosome. Thus,
through regulating actin cytoskeleton organization and membrane
trafficking, phosphoinositides play crucial roles in a variety of cell
functions such as growth, polarity, movement, and pattern formation.},

Singer and Nicolson in 1972, the lipid bilayer is represented as a neutral

dominated by a membrane lipid bilayer, directly exposed to the aqueous
environment, and only occasionally interrupted by transmembrane proteins.
This view is reproduced in virtually every textbook in biochemistry and
cell biology, yet some critical features have yet to be closely examined,
including the key parameter of the relative occupancy of protein and lipid
at the center of a natural membrane. Here we show that the area occupied
by protein and lipid at the center of the human red blood cell (RBC)
plasma membrane is at least approximately 23\% protein and less than
approximately 77\% lipid. This measurement is in close agreement with
previous estimates for the RBC plasma membrane and the recently published
measurements for the synaptic vesicle. Given that transmembrane proteins
are surrounded by phospholipids that are perturbed by their presence, the
occupancy by protein of more than approximately 20\% of the RBC plasma
membrane and the synaptic vesicle plasma membrane implies that natural
membrane bilayers may be more rigid and less fluid than has been thought
for the past several decades, and that studies of pure lipid bilayers do
not fully reveal the properties of lipids in membranes. Thus, it appears
to be the case that membranes may be more mosaic than fluid, with little
unperturbed phospholipid bilayer.},

Biophysical aspects of membrane shape coupled to sorting have recently
received increasing attention. Here we determine membrane tube bending
stiffness through measurements of tube radii, and demonstrate that the
stiffness of ternary lipid mixtures depends on membrane curvature for a
large range of lipid compositions. This observation indicates
amplification by curvature of cooperative lipid demixing. We show that
curvature-induced demixing increases upon approaching the critical region
of a ternary lipid mixture, with qualitative differences along two roughly
orthogonal compositional trajectories. Adapting a thermodynamic theory
earlier developed by M. Kozlov, we derive an expression that shows the
renormalized bending stiffness of an amphiphile mixture membrane tube in
contact with a flat reservoir to be a quadratic function of curvature. In
this analytical model, the degree of sorting is determined by the ratio of
two thermodynamic derivatives. These derivatives are individually
interpreted as a driving force and a resistance to curvature sorting. We
experimentally show this ratio to vary with composition, and compare the
model to sorting by spontaneous curvature. Our results are likely to be
relevant to the molecular sorting of membrane components in vivo.},

fluorescence imaging of living NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing the

dynamic, phase-dense features identified as ruffles and with
microvillus-like protrusions from the cell's dorsal surface. Imaging of
fixed and permeabilized cells shows co-localization of PH-EGFP with
F-actin in ruffles, but not with vinculin in focal adhesions. The
selective concentration of the PH-EGFP fusion protein in highly dynamic

selectivity, subunit oligomerization, and regulation by intracellular
signaling molecules. Considering modular organization and recent
structural information in the ion channel field, we have modeled a
full-length TRPV1 by assembly of its major modules: the cytosolic
N-terminal, C-terminal, and membrane-spanning region. For N-terminal, we
used the ankyrin repeat structure fused with the N-end segment. The
membrane domain was modeled with the structure of the eukaryotic,
voltage-gated Kv1.2 K+ channel. The C-terminus was cast using the
coordinates of HCN channels. The extensive structure-function data
available for TRPV1 was used to validate the models in terms of the
location of molecular determinants of function in the structure.
Additionally, the current information allowed the modeling of the
vanilloid receptor in the closed and desensitized states. The closed state
shows the N-terminal module highly exposed and accessible to adenosine
triphosphate and the C-terminal accessible to phosphoinositides. In
contrast, the desensitized state depicts the N-terminal and C-terminal
modules close together, compatible with an interaction mediated by Ca2+
-calmodulin complex. These models identify potential previously
unrecognized intra- and interdomain interactions that may play an

	abstract = {On mesoscopic scales, lipid membranes are well described by continuum
theories whose main ingredients are the curvature of a membrane's
reference surface and the tilt of its lipid constituents. In particular,
Hamm and Kozlov [Eur. Phys. J. E 3, 323 (2000)] have shown how to
systematically derive such a tilt-curvature Hamiltonian based on the
elementary assumption of a thin fluid elastic sheet experiencing internal
lateral pre-stress. Performing a dimensional reduction, they not only
derive the basic form of the effective surface Hamiltonian but also
express its emergent elastic couplings as trans-membrane moments of
lower-level material parameters. In the present paper, we argue, though,
that their derivation unfortunately missed a coupling term between
curvature and tilt. This term arises because, as one moves along the
membrane, the curvature-induced change of transverse distances contributes
to the area strain-an effect that was believed to be small but
nevertheless ends up contributing at the same (quadratic) order as all
other terms in their Hamiltonian. We illustrate the consequences of this
amendment by deriving the monolayer and bilayer Euler-Lagrange equations
for the tilt, as well as the power spectra of shape, tilt, and director
fluctuations. A particularly curious aspect of our new term is that its
associated coupling constant is the second moment of the lipid monolayer's
lateral stress profile-which within this framework is equal to the
monolayer Gaussian curvature modulus, κ¯m. On the one hand, this implies
that many theoretical predictions now contain a parameter that is poorly
known (because the Gauss-Bonnet theorem limits access to the integrated
Gaussian curvature); on the other hand, the appearance of κ¯m outside of
its Gaussian curvature provenance opens opportunities for measuring it by
more conventional means, for instance by monitoring a membrane's
undulation spectrum at short scales.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actin polymerization by Arp2/3 complex must be tightly
regulated to promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Although many Arp2/3
complex activators have been identified, mechanisms for its negative
regulation have remained more elusive. To address this, we analyzed the
yeast arp2-7 allele, which is biochemically unique in causing unregulated
actin assembly in vitro in the absence of Arp2/3 activators. RESULTS: We
examined endocytosis in arp2-7 mutants by live-cell imaging of Sla1-GFP, a
coat marker, and Abp1-RFP, which marks the later actin phase of
endocytosis. Sla1-GFP and Abp1-RFP lifetimes were accelerated in arp2-7
mutants, which is opposite to actin nucleation-impaired arp2 alleles or
deletions of Arp2/3 activators. We performed a screen for multicopy
suppressors of arp2-7 and identified SYP1, an FCHO1 homolog, which
contains F-BAR and AP-2micro homology domains. Overexpression of SYP1 in
arp2-7 cells slowed Sla1-GFP lifetimes closer to wild-type cells. Further,
purified Syp1 directly inhibited Las17/WASp stimulation of Arp2/3
complex-mediated actin assembly in vitro. This activity was mapped to a
fragment of Syp1 located between its F-BAR and AP-2micro homology domains
and depends on sequences in Las17/WASp outside of the VCA domain.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data identify Syp1 as a novel negative
regulator of WASp-Arp2/3 complex that helps choreograph the precise timing
of actin assembly during endocytosis.},

simulations. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the
assessment and improvement of commonly used force fields for describing
conformational dynamics of folded proteins. However, the accuracy for the
unfolded states remains unclear. The latter is however important for
detailed studies of protein folding pathways, conformational transitions
involving unfolded states, and dynamics of intrinsically disordered
proteins. In this work, we compare the three commonly used force fields,
AMBER ff99SB-ILDN, CHARMM22/CMAP, and CHARMM36, for modeling the natively
unfolded fragment peptides, NTL9(1-22) and NTL9(6-17), using
explicit-solvent replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations. All
three simulations show that NTL9(6-17) is completely unstructured, while
NTL9(1-22) transiently samples various β-hairpin states, reminiscent of
the first β-hairpin in the structure of the intact NTL9 protein. The
radius of gyration of the two peptides is force field independent but
likely underestimated due to the current deficiency of additive force
fields. Compared to the CHARMM force fields, ff99SB-ILDN gives slightly
higher β-sheet propensity and more native-like residual structures for
NTL9(1-22), which may be attributed to its known β preference.
Surprisingly, only two sequence-local pairs of charged residues make
appreciable ionic contacts in the simulations of NTL9(1-22), which are
sampled slightly more by the CHARMM force fields. Taken together, these
data suggest that the current CHARMM and AMBER force fields are globally
in agreement in modeling the unfolded states corresponding to β-sheet in
the folded structure, while differing in details such as the
native-likeness of the residual structures and interactions.},

combined coarse-grained MD simulations with umbrella sampling to quantify

reduced the free energy of PIP binding. The presence of a noncanonical

	abstract = {A fundamental understanding of the intermolecular forces that bind
polysaccharide chains together in cellulose is crucial for designing
efficient methods to overcome the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass
to hydrolysis. Because the characteristic time and length scales for the
degradation of cellulose by enzymatic hydrolysis or chemical pretreatment
span orders of magnitude, it is important to closely integrate the
molecular models used at each scale so that, ultimately, one may switch
seamlessly between quantum, atomistic, and coarse-grained descriptions of
the system. As a step towards that goal, four multiscale coarse-grained
models for polysaccharide chains in a cellulose-Iα microfiber are
considered. Using the force matching method, effective coarse-grained
forces are derived from all-atom trajectories. Performance of the
coarse-grained models is evaluated by comparing the intrachain radial
distribution functions with those obtained using the all-atom reference
data. The all-atom simulation reveals a double peak in the radial
distribution function for sites within each glucose residue that arises
from the distinct conformations sampled by the primary alcohol group in
the glucose residues. The three-site and four-site coarse-grained models
have sufficient degrees of freedom to predict this double peak while the
one-site and two-site models do not. This is the first time that
coarse-grained models have been shown to reproduce such subtle, yet
important, molecular features in a polysaccharide chain. The relative
orientations between glucose residues along the polysaccharide chain are
evaluated and it is found that the four-site coarse-grained model is best
at reproducing the glucose-glucose conformations observed in the all-atom
simulation. The success of the four-site coarse-grained model underscores
the importance of decoupling the pyranose ring from the oxygen atom in the
glycosidic bond when developing all-atom to coarse-grained mapping schemes
for polysaccharides.},

long-standing problem in the field of liposome-based gene delivery.
Although it is well-established that divalent cations can promote
formation of stable DNA-phospholipid complexes, the underlying molecular
mechanism remains largely unknown. Here we employ computer simulations to
gain atomistically resolved insight into the kinetics of calcium-induced
adsorption of DNA on zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine membranes as well as
into the structure and stability of the resulting complexes. Overall, our
findings show that calcium ions play a dual role in DNA-phospholipid
systems. First, binding of divalent cations to the lipid-water interface
turns the surface of the zwitterionic membrane positively charged,
promoting thereby the initial electrostatic attraction of a polyanionic
DNA molecule. Second, we show that calcium ions are crucial for
stabilizing the DNA-lipid membrane complex as they bridge together
phosphate groups of DNA and lipid molecules. In contrast to previous
hypotheses, we demonstrate that direct interactions between choline groups
of phospholipids and DNA phosphates play only a rudimentary role as they
are relatively short-lived and unstable: typical residence times for such
interactions are 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those for Ca-mediated
bridges between DNA and lipid phosphate groups. The results of our study
can serve as a basis for a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms
behind noncovalent binding of DNA and DNA-based nanodevices to complex
surfaces such as cell membranes.},

	abstract = {Several theories of phospholipid homeostasis have postulated that cells
regulate the molecular composition of their bilayer membranes, such that a
common biophysical membrane parameter is under homeostatic control. Two
commonly cited theories are the intrinsic curvature hypothesis, which
states that cells control membrane curvature elastic stress, and the
theory of homeoviscous adaptation, which postulates cells control acyl
chain packing order (membrane order). In this paper, we present evidence
from data-driven modelling studies that these two theories correlate in
vivo. We estimate the curvature elastic stress of mammalian cells to be
4-7 × 10(-12) N, a value high enough to suggest that in mammalian cells
the preservation of membrane order arises through a mechanism where
membrane curvature elastic stress is controlled. These results emerge from
analysing the molecular contribution of individual phospholipids to both
membrane order and curvature elastic stress in nearly 500 cellular
compositionally diverse lipidomes. Our model suggests that the de novo
synthesis of lipids is the dominant mechanism by which cells control
curvature elastic stress and hence membrane order in vivo These results
also suggest that cells can increase membrane curvature elastic stress
disproportionately to membrane order by incorporating polyunsaturated
fatty acids into lipids.},

documented protein allostery cases are rising quickly. Since all dynamic
proteins are potentially allosteric and allostery plays crucial roles in
all cellular pathways, sorting and classifying allosteric mechanisms in
proteins should be extremely useful in understanding and predicting how
the signals are regulated and transmitted through the dynamic
multi-molecular cellular organizations. Classification organizes the
complex information thereby unraveling relationships and patterns in
molecular activation and repression. In signaling, current classification
schemes consider classes of molecules according to their functions; for
example, epinephrine and norepinephrine secreted by the central nervous
system are classified as neurotransmitters. Other schemes would account
for epinephrine when secreted by the adrenal medulla to be hormone-like.
Yet, such classifications account for the global function of the molecule;
not for the molecular mechanism of how the signal transmission initiates
and how it is transmitted. Here we provide a unified view of allostery and
the first classification framework. We expect that a classification scheme
would assist in comprehension of allosteric mechanisms, in prediction of
signaling on the molecular level, in better comprehension of pathways and
regulation of the complex signals, in translating them to the cascading
events, and in allosteric drug design. We further provide a range of
examples illustrating mechanisms in protein allostery and their
classification from the cellular functional standpoint.},

theoretical approaches to investigate the molecular details of the
interactions and dynamics of a lipid recognition module, the pleckstrin

dynamics simulations using combinations of atomistic and coarse-grained

membrane localization and interactions of PH domains with membranes in
addition to the canonical binding mode. In the last part of this review, I
address the dynamics of PH domains on the membrane surface. Local PIP
clusters formed around the proteins exhibit anomalous fluctuations. This
dynamic change in protein-lipid interactions cause temporally fluctuating
diffusivity of proteins, i.e., the short-term diffusivity of the bound

enzyme-assisted lipid transfer by flippases, floppases and scramblases is
briefly discussed, while non-catalyzed lipid flip-flop is reviewed in more
detail. Transbilayer lipid motion may occur as a result of the insertion
of foreign molecules (detergents, lipids, or even proteins) in one of the
membrane leaflets. It may also be the result of the enzymatic generation
of lipids, e.g. diacylglycerol or ceramide, at one side of the membrane.
Transbilayer motion rates decrease in the order
diacylglycerol{\textgreater}ceramide{\textgreater}phospholipids. Ceramide, but not diacylglycerol,
can induce transbilayer motion of other lipids, and bilayer scrambling.
Transbilayer lipid diffusion and bilayer scrambling are defined as two
conceptually and mechanistically different processes. The mechanism of
scrambling appears to be related to local instabilities caused by the

	abstract = {We present a procedure to obtain Coarse-Grained (CG) models for aqueous
polysaccharide solutions that are transferable over different degrees of
polymerization and different polysaccharide concentrations based on
atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. This is achieved by a
hybrid procedure combining Boltzmann Inversion (BI) and the Multiscale
Coarse-Graining (MS-CG) method. In order to overcome problems that have
been previously reported with this approach, namely differences in the
aggregation behavior and the end to end distance between the atomistic
reference simulation and the coarse-grained simulation, we employ a
separation-ansatz and explicit 1-3 and 1-4 nonbonded intramolecular
interactions. This allows the use of the model for long polysaccharides.
We demonstrate the transferability over both concentration and degrees of
polymerization, evaluate the scope for which the coarse-grained model can
be applied, and then present a scheme to extend the concentration
transferability. In addition, we show that the procedure can be applied to
generate a transferable implicit solvent model and demonstrate that it can
be used for different atomistic force fields (FFs) as well. The procedure
is then applied to derive a coarse-grained model of different
hemicellulose polysaccharides. The resulting model is used to demonstrate
that branching with monomer side-chains significantly increases the water
uptake capacity of the molecules in comparison to linear polysaccharides
which is consistent with experimental results.},

	abstract = {Assembly of HIV-1 particles is initiated by the trafficking of viral Gag
polyproteins from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, where they
co-localize and bud to form immature particles. Membrane targeting is
mediated by the N-terminally myristoylated matrix (MA) domain of Gag and
is dependent on the plasma membrane marker
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. Recent studies revealed
that PI(4,5)P2 molecules containing truncated acyl chains [tr-PI(4,5)P2]
are capable of binding MA in an "extended lipid" conformation and
promoting myristoyl exposure. Here we report that tr-PI(4,5)P2 molecules
also readily bind to non-membrane proteins, including HIV-1 capsid, which
prompted us to re-examine MA-PI(4,5)P2 interactions using native lipids
and membrane mimetic liposomes and bicelles. Liposome binding trends
observed using a recently developed NMR approach paralleled results of
flotation assays, although the affinities measured under the equilibrium
conditions of NMR experiments were significantly higher. Native PI(4,5)P2
enhanced MA binding to liposomes designed to mimic non-raft-like regions
of the membrane, suggesting the possibility that binding of the protein to
disordered domains may precede Gag association with, or nucleation of,
rafts. Studies with bicelles revealed a subset of surface and
myr-associated MA residues that are sensitive to native PI(4,5)P2, but
cleft residues that interact with the 2'-acyl chains of tr-PI(4,5)P2
molecules in aqueous solution were insensitive to native PI(4,5)P2 in
bicelles. Our findings call to question extended-lipid MA:membrane binding
models, and instead support a model put forward from coarse-grained
simulations indicating that binding is mediated predominantly by dynamic,
electrostatic interactions between conserved basic residues of MA and
multiple PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylserine molecules.},

binding properties of the RecA protein at the surface of anionic

differently when bound to phosphatidylglycerol (PG)- and cardiolipin
(CL)-containing liposomes. We use a multistage computational protocol that
integrates an implicit membrane/solvent model, the highly mobile mimetic
membrane model, and the full atomistic membrane model to study how
different anionic lipids perturb RecA binding to the membrane. With
anionic lipids studied here, the binding interface involves three key
regions: the N-terminal helix, the DNA binding loop L2, and the M-M7
region. The nature of binding involves both electrostatic interactions
between cationic protein residues and lipid polar/charged groups and
insertion of hydrophobic residues. The L2 loop contributes more to
membrane insertion than the N-terminal helix. More subtle aspects of
RecA-membrane interaction are influenced by specific properties of anionic
lipids. Ionic hydrogen bonds between the carboxylate group in
phosphatidylserine and several lysine residues in the C-terminal region of
RecA stabilize the parallel (∥) binding orientation, which is not locally
stable on PG- and CL-containing membranes despite similarity in the
overall charge density. Lipid packing defects, which are more prevalent in
the presence of conical lipids, are observed to enhance the insertion
depth of hydrophobic motifs. The computational finding that RecA binds in
a similar orientation to PG- and CL-containing membranes is consistent
with the fact that PG alone is sufficient to induce RecA polar
localization, although CL might be more effective because of its tighter
binding to RecA. The different fluorescence behaviors of RecA upon binding
to PG- and CL-containing liposomes is likely due to the different
structures and flexibility of the C-terminal region of RecA when it binds
to different anionic phospholipids.},

progress, because of new high-resolution structures, advances in computer

several large ion channel simulations, recent studies have explored how
individual amino acids interact with the bilayer or snorkel/anchor to the

partition free energies. This has resulted in a view of bilayers as being
adaptive rather than purely hydrophobic solvents, with important
implications, for example, for interaction between lipids and arginines in
the charged S4 helix of voltage-gated ion channels. However, several
studies indicate that the typical current simulations fall short of
exhaustive sampling, and that even simple protein-membrane interactions
require at least ca. 1 micros to fully sample their dynamics. One new way
this is being addressed is coarse-grained models that enable mesoscopic
simulations on multi-micros scale. These have been used to model
interactions, self-assembly and membrane perturbations induced by
proteins. While they cannot replace all-atom simulations, they are a
potentially useful technique for initial insertion, placement, and
low-resolution refinement.},

lateral pressure term stabilizes interfacial binding due to the negative
pressure at the hydrocarbon-water interface. In agreement with experiment,
increase in the peptide/lipid molar ratio shifts the equilibrium from the
interfacial to the transmembrane orientation. Simulations of mixed
DOPC/DOPE bilayers show that increase of the DOPE mole fraction in general
stabilizes interfacial orientations and destabilizes transmembrane
orientations. The extent of the stabilization or destabilization varies

leaflets which are typically exposed to different aqueous environments and
may differ in their molecular density or composition. Because of these
asymmetries, the membranes prefer to curve in a certain manner as
quantitatively described by their spontaneous curvature. Here, we study
such asymmetric membranes via coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations. We consider two mechanisms for the generation of spontaneous
curvature: (i) different lipid densities within the two leaflets and (ii)
leaflets exposed to different concentrations of adsorbing particles. We
focus on membranes that experience no mechanical tension and describe two
methods to compute the spontaneous curvature. The first method is based on
the detailed structure of the bilayer's stress profile which can hardly be
measured experimentally. The other method starts from the intuitive view
that the bilayer represents a thin fluid film bounded by two interfaces
and reduces the complexity of the stress profile to a few membrane
parameters that can be measured experimentally. For the case of asymmetric
adsorption, we introduce a simulation protocol based on two bilayers
separated by two aqueous compartments with different adsorbate
concentrations. The adsorption of small particles with a size below 1 nm
is shown to generate large spontaneous curvatures up to about 1/(24 nm).
Our computational approach is quite general: it can be applied to any
molecular model of bilayer membranes and can be extended to other
mechanisms for the generation of spontaneous curvatures as provided, e.g.,
by asymmetric lipid composition or depletion layers of solute molecules.},

One of the fundamental features of the spindle across the species is its
symmetrical shape; the spindle consists of two polar arrays of
microtubules at both ends. Although it has been suggested that the
formation of the bipolar shape requires force balance coordination by
molecular motors, i.e., kinesins and dyneins, quantitative analysis for
the pole mechanics has not been conducted. Here, we demonstrate that it is
not only the shape but also the stiffness and microtubule density of the
pairs of pole regions are symmetrically balanced in single spindles
self-assembled in Xenopus egg extracts. We found that the inhibition of
dynein functions dramatically reduced the stiffness and microtubule
density in the pole region. By contrast, the inhibition of one of the
kinesins, Eg5, which is the antagonistic motor protein of dynein,
increased the value of these parameters. Moreover, the inhibition of both
dynein and Eg5 recovered these parameter values to those of non-treated
spindle poles. We also found that, when one pole structure was held
widened with the use of two glass microneedles, the opposite pole
structure spontaneously widened, resulting in the formation of the
barrel-like shaped spindle. The values of stiffness and microtubule
density in the manipulated pole region decreased, following the
spontaneous decrement of those in the paired unmanipulated pole region.
These results suggest that the spindle possesses a mechanism to
dynamically maintain its symmetry in mechanical properties.},

The ring closes via actomyosin contraction coupled with actin
depolymerization. Of interest, ring closure and hence the furrow
ingression are nonconcentric (asymmetric) within the division plane across
Metazoa. This nonconcentricity can occur and persist even without
preexisting asymmetric cues, such as spindle placement or cellular
adhesions. Cell-autonomous asymmetry is not explained by current models.
We combined quantitative high-resolution live-cell microscopy with
theoretical modeling to explore the mechanistic basis for asymmetric
cytokinesis in theCaenorhabditis eleganszygote, with the goal of
uncovering basic principles of ring closure. Our theoretical model
suggests that feedback among membrane curvature, cytoskeletal alignment,
and contractility is responsible for asymmetric cytokinetic furrowing. It
also accurately predicts experimental perturbations of conserved ring
proteins. The model further suggests that curvature-mediated filament
alignment speeds up furrow closure while promoting energy efficiency.

systematically test the use of the C36 lipid FF in NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER,

schemes and integrator algorithms were tested to find the optimal
simulation protocol to best match bilayer properties of six lipids with
varying acyl chain saturation and head groups. MD simulations of a
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer were used to obtain
the optimal protocol for each program. MD simulations with all programs
were found to reasonably match the DPPC bilayer properties (surface area
per lipid, chain order parameters, and area compressibility modulus)
obtained using the standard protocol used in CHARMM as well as from
experiments. The optimal simulation protocol was then applied to the other
five lipid simulations and resulted in excellent agreement between results
from most simulation programs as well as with experimental data. AMBER
compared least favorably with the expected membrane properties, which
appears to be due to its use of the hard-truncation in the LJ potential
versus a force-based switching function used to smooth the LJ potential as
it approaches the cutoff distance. The optimal simulation protocol for

	abstract = {Regulation of ion transport in plants is essential for cell function.
Abiotic stress unbalances cell ion homeostasis, and plants tend to
readjust it, regulating membrane transporters and channels. The plant
hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and the second messenger Ca(2+) are central in
such processes, as they are involved in the regulation of protein kinases
and phosphatases that control ion transport activity in response to
environmental stimuli. The identification and characterization of the
molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of ABA and Ca(2+) signaling
pathways on membrane function are central and could provide opportunities
for crop improvement. The C2-domain ABA-related (CAR) family of small
proteins is involved in the Ca(2+)-dependent recruitment of the pyrabactin
resistance 1/PYR1-like (PYR/PYL) ABA receptors to the membrane. However,
to fully understand CAR function, it is necessary to define a molecular
mechanism that integrates Ca(2+) sensing, membrane interaction, and the
recognition of the PYR/PYL interacting partners. We present structural and
biochemical data showing that CARs are peripheral membrane proteins that
functionally cluster on the membrane and generate strong positive membrane
curvature in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These features represent a
mechanism for the generation, stabilization, and/or specific recognition
of membrane discontinuities. Such structures may act as signaling
platforms involved in the recruitment of PYR/PYL receptors and other
signaling components involved in cell responses to stress.},

length originally identified in the Ca(2+)-dependent isoforms of protein
kinase C. Single and multiple copies of C2 domains have been identified in
a growing number of eukaryotic signalling proteins that interact with
cellular membranes and mediate a broad array of critical intracellular
processes, including membrane trafficking, the generation of lipid-second
messengers, activation of GTPases, and the control of protein
phosphorylation. As a group, C2 domains display the remarkable property of
binding a variety of different ligands and substrates, including Ca2+,
phospholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and intracellular proteins.
Expanding this functional diversity is the fact that not all proteins
containing C2 domains are regulated by Ca2+, suggesting that some C2
domains may play a purely structural role or may have lost the ability to
bind Ca2+. The present review summarizes the information currently
available regarding the structure and function of the C2 domain and
provides a novel sequence alignment of 65 C2 domain primary structures.
This alignment predicts that C2 domains form two distinct topological
folds, illustrated by the recent crystal structures of C2 domains from
synaptotagmin 1 and phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-delta 1,
respectively. The alignment highlights residues that may be critical to
the C2 domain fold or required for Ca2+ binding and regulation.},

the neutral surface of bending and favoring positive curvature. The effect
is not observed for unsaturated (flexible) acyl chains. Likewise, hydrogen

at sufficient concentration, below which the lipid prefers negative

highlight how advances in live-cell fluorescence microscopy have affected
the study of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The last decade has seen a
tremendous increase in the development and dissemination of methods for
imaging endocytosis in live cells, and this has been followed by a
dramatic shift in the way this critical cellular pathway is studied and
understood. The present review begins with a description of the technical
advances which have permitted new types of experiment to be performed, as
well as potential pitfalls of these new technologies. Subsequently,
advances in the understanding of three key endocytic proteins will be
addressed: clathrin, dynamin and AP-2 (adaptor protein 2). Although great
strides have clearly been made in these areas in recent years, as is often
the case, each answer has bred numerous questions. Furthermore, several
examples are highlighted where, because of seemingly minor differences in
experimental systems, what appear at first to be very similar studies
have, at times, yielded vastly differing results and conclusions. Thus
this is an exceedingly exciting time to study endocytosis, and this area
serves as a clear demonstration of the power of applying live-cell imaging

state with a well-defined activation energy barrier DeltaE, as the

saddle point of the free-energy surface in most reactions is populated by
ensembles of conformations, leading to nonexponential kinetics. Here we
present a theory that generalizes the Arrhenius equation to include static
disorder of conformational degrees of freedom as a function of an external
perturbation to fully account for a diverse set of transition states. The
effect of a perturbation on static disorder is best examined at the
single-molecule level. Here we use force-clamp spectroscopy to study the
nonexponential kinetics of single ubiquitin proteins unfolding under
force. We find that the measured variance in DeltaE shows both
force-dependent and independent components, where the force-dependent
component scales with F(2), in excellent agreement with our theory. Our
study illustrates a novel adaptation of the classical Arrhenius equation
that accounts for the microscopic origins of nonexponential kinetics,

theoretical work, we consider the electrostatic attraction that underlies
the scaffold mechanism of membrane bending in the context of the N-BAR

simulations reveals considerable water between the membrane and the
positively charged concave face of the BAR, even when it is tightly bound
to highly curved membranes. This results in significant screening of
electrostatic interactions, suggesting that electrostatic attraction is
not the main driving force behind curvature sensing, supporting recent
experimental work. These results also emphasize the need for care when
building coarse-grained models of protein-membrane interactions. These
results are emphasized by simulations of oligomerized amphiphysin N-BARs
at the atomistic and coarse-grained level. In the coarse-grained
simulations, we find a strong dependence of the induced curvature on the

a disproportionate number of domains or segments that are intrinsically

role. Despite numerous hypotheses for the role of ID domains in

allosteric proteins. Here, we present such a model and show that
site-to-site allosteric coupling is maximized when intrinsic disorder is
present in the domains or segments containing one or both of the coupled
binding sites. This result not only explains the prevalence of ID domains
in regulatory proteins, it also calls into question the classical
mechanical view of energy propagation in proteins, which predicts that
site-to-site coupling would be maximized when a well defined pathway of
folded structure connects the two sites. Furthermore, in showing that the
coupling mechanism conferred by intrinsic disorder is robust and
independent of the network of interactions that physically link the

assemble at the base of emerging membrane buds. Our work shows that beyond
a more straightforward scaffolding mechanism at high bound densities, the

technologically advanced, these methods are in many cases limited by data

computationally demanding and poses a bottleneck for all
SAXS/WAXS-assisted structural refinement and, in particular, for the

to represent biomolecules as collections of coarse-grained scatterers.
Here, such coarse-graining schemes are presented and discussed and their
accuracies examined. It is demonstrated that scattering factors coincident
with the popular MARTINI coarse-graining scheme produce reliable
difference scattering in the range 0 {\textless} q {\textless} 0.75 Å-1. The findings are
promising for future attempts at X-ray scattering data analysis, and may

umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and a model of the
mononuclear phagocyte system (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate

rhodamine-label dextran (LRDNG) via Maillard reaction followed by
heat-gelation reaction and were loaded with a fluorescent probe,
5-hexadecanoylaminofluorescein (HAF), as a mock drug. Epifluorescence
microscopy confirmed rapid uptake of LRDNG by HUVEC. Although LysoTracker
Green staining indicated a lysosomal fate for LRDNG, the mock drug cargo
(HAF) diffused extensively inside the cell within 15 min. Flow cytometry
and confocal microscopy indicated slow uptake of LRDNG in PMA-stimulated
THP-1 cells, with only 41\% of cells containing LRDNG after 24 h exposure.
Finally, 24 h exposure to LRDNG did not affect the viability of either
cell type at the dose studied (20 μg/ml). At a higher dose (200 μg/ml),
LRDNG resulted in a marked loss of viability of HUVEC and THP-1, measuring
30\% and 38\%, respectively. Collectively, our results demonstrate the great

	abstract = {Proteins anchored to membranes through covalently linked fatty acids
and/or isoprenoid groups play crucial roles in all forms of life. Sorting
and trafficking of lipidated proteins has traditionally been discussed in
the context of partitioning to membrane domains of different lipid
composition. We recently showed that membrane shape/curvature can in
itself mediate the recruitment of lipidated proteins. However, exactly how
membrane curvature and composition synergize remains largely unexplored.
Here we investigated how three critical structural parameters of lipids,
namely acyl chain saturation, headgroup size, and acyl chain length,
modulate the capacity of membrane curvature to recruit lipidated proteins.
As a model system we used the lipidated minimal membrane anchor of the
GTPase, N-Ras (tN-Ras). Our data revealed complex synergistic effects,
whereby tN-Ras binding was higher on planar DOPC than POPC membranes, but
inversely higher on curved POPC than DOPC membranes. This variation in the
binding to both planar and curved membranes leads to a net increase in the
recruitment by membrane curvature of tN-Ras when reducing the acyl chain
saturation state. Additionally, we found increased recruitment by membrane
curvature of tN-Ras when substituting PC for PE, and when decreasing acyl
chain length from 14 to 12 carbons (DMPC versus DLPC). However, these
variations in recruitment ability had different origins, with the
headgroup size primarily influencing tN-Ras binding to planar membranes
whereas the change in acyl chain length primarily affected binding to
curved membranes. Molecular field theory calculations recapitulated these
findings and revealed lateral pressure as an underlying biophysical
mechanism dictating how curvature and composition synergize to modulate
recruitment of lipidated proteins. Our findings suggest that the different
compositions of cellular compartments could modulate the potency of
membrane curvature to recruit lipidated proteins and thereby
synergistically regulate the trafficking and sorting of lipidated
proteins.},

importance of two subunits of CIII (G and K in bovine heart) for the
structural integrity of these internal CL binding sites. In addition, new
binding sites are found on the membrane-exposed protein surface. The
reproducibility of these binding sites over two species (bovine heart and

located on the matrix side of CIII in the inner membrane and thus may
provide localized sources of proton ready for uptake by CIII. Furthermore,

protein-tagged endocytic protein was referenced to the disappearance of
spot-like clathrin-coated structure (CCS), but the precision of spot-like
CCS disappearance as a marker for canonical CME remained unknown. Here we
have used an imaging assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence
microscopy to detect scission events with a resolution of ∼ 2 s. We found
that scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor
cargo at CCSs of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear
following scission. We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of
endocytic protein to scission events: Abp1, ACK1, amphiphysin1, APPL1,

was recruited, in the same order, to scission events at CCSs of different

temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of
mammalian CME in which the same core mechanism of CME, involving actin,

similar to the structure of the BAR domain; however, the RCB domain/IMD
has a "zeppelin-shaped" dimer. Interestingly, the RCB domain/IMD of IRSp53
possesses Rac binding, membrane binding, and actin filament binding
abilities. Here we report that the RCB domain/IMD of IRSp53 induces
membrane deformation independent of the actin filaments in a Rac-dependent
manner. In contrast to the BAR domain, the RCB domain/IMD did not cause
long tubulation of the artificial liposomes; however, the Rac binding
domain caused the formation of small buds on the liposomal surface. When
expressed in cells, the Rac binding domain induced outward protrusion of
the plasma membrane in a direction opposite to that induced by the BAR

suggests that the convex surface of the Rac binding domain binds to the

anomalous, non-Brownian diffusion of both lipid molecules and proteins

diffusion becomes significantly longer ranged on the addition of
disorder-through the addition of cholesterol or proteins-and on passing of
the membrane lipids to the gel phase. Concurrently, experiments
demonstrate the anomalous diffusion of membrane embedded proteins up to
macroscopic time scales in the minute time range. Particular emphasis will

particular, the occurrence of ageing observed in the experiments-the
effective diffusivity of the measured particles is a decreasing function
of time. Moreover, we present results for the time dependent local scaling
exponent of the mean squared displacement of the monitored particles.
Recent results finding deviations from the commonly assumed Gaussian
diffusion patterns in protein crowded membranes are reported. The
properties of the displacement autocorrelation function of the lipid
molecules are discussed in the light of their appropriate physical
anomalous diffusion models, both for non-crowded and crowded membranes. In
the last part of this review we address the upcoming field of membrane
distortion by elongated membrane-binding particles. We discuss how
membrane compartmentalisation and the particle-membrane binding energy may
impact the dynamics and response of lipid membranes. This article is part

an efficient local membrane property calculation, comprising bilayer
thickness, area per lipid, deuterium order parameters, Gaussian and mean
curvature. The local membrane property calculation allows for a direct
mapping of the membrane features, which subsequently can be used for
further analysis and visualization of the processes of interest. The main
features of the described methods are highlighted in a number of membrane

fusion peptide interacting with a membrane, voltage-dependent anion
channel protein embedded in a DMPC bilayer, cholesterol enriched bilayer

hardware-accelerated aqueous molecular dynamics to model μs motions in
N-glycans that underpin inflammation and immunity. In 10μs simulations,
conformational equilibria of mannosyl cores, sialyl Lewis (sLe) antennae,
and constituent sub-sequences agreed with prior refinements (X-ray and

branching, linkage position, and secondary structure, implicating sequence

conformational transitions that have eluded precise quantification by
experiment and conventional (ns) simulations were predicted to occur on μs
timescales. All rings populated non-chair shapes and the stacked galactose

theoretical, and simulation approaches to explore how BAR proteins

quantitative microscopy with analytical modeling, we demonstrate that a
highly curving BAR protein endophilin nucleates its scaffolds at the ends
of a membrane tube, contrary to a weaker curving protein centaurin, which
binds evenly along the tube's length. Our work implies that the nature of
local protein-membrane interactions can affect the specific localization
of proteins on membrane-remodeling sites. Furthermore, we show that
amphipathic helices are dispensable in forming protein scaffolds. Finally,
we explore a possible molecular structure of a BAR-domain scaffold using
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Together with fluorescence
microscopy, the simulations show that proteins need only to cover 30-40\%

force. Although force measurements have indicated a step-like behavior in

lower than the independently determined free energy barriers. Here we
explore memory effects leading to anomalous diffusion as a possible origin
of this discrepancy. Our analysis of several molecular dynamics
trajectories shows that the dynamics of common reaction coordinates used
to describe protein folding is subdiffusive, at least at sufficiently
short times. We capture this effect using a one-dimensional fractional
Brownian motion (FBM) model, in which the system undergoes a subdiffusive
process in the presence of a potential of mean force, and show that this
model yields much broader distributions of transition path times with
stretched exponential long-time tails. Without any adjustable parameters,
these distributions agree well with the transition path times computed
directly from protein trajectories. We further discuss how the FBM model
can be tested experimentally.},

membrane along the endocytic pathway is a fundamental cellular process.
Over the last two decades, this pathway has emerged to be subject to
extensive regulation by phosphoinositides (PIs), phosphorylated
derivatives of the minor membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol.
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the endocytic mechanism
characterized in most detail. It now represents a prime example of a
process spatiotemporally organized by the interplay of PI metabolizing
enzymes. The most abundant PI, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
[PI(4,5)P₂], serves as a denominator of plasma membrane identity and
together with cargo proteins is instrumental for the initiation of
clathrin-coated pit (CCP) formation. During later stages of the process,
the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P₂] and
the dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P₂regulate CCP maturation and vesicle
uncoating. Here we provide an overview of the mechanisms by which PIs are
made and consumed to regulate CME and other endocytic pathways and how
conversion of PIs en route to endosomes may be accomplished. Mutations in
PI converting enzymes are linked to multiple diseases ranging from mental
retardation and neurodegeneration, to inherited muscle and kidney
disorders suggesting that the tight control of PI levels along the

experiments, and fluorescence microscopy have come a long way to probe
structural and dynamical information at multiple scales. However, some
details are simply too small or the processes are too short-lived to
detect by experiments. Computational biology provides a bridge to
understand experimental results at the molecular level, makes predictions
that have not been seen in vivo, and motivates new fields of research.
This review focuses on the advances on peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs)
studies; what is known about their interaction with membranes, their role
in cell biology, and some limitations that both experiment and computation
still have to overcome to gain better structural and functional
understanding of these PMPs. As many recent reviews have acknowledged,
interdisciplinary efforts between experiment and computation are needed in
order to have useful models that lead future directions in the study of
PMPs. We present new results of a case study on a PMP that behaves as an
intricate machine controlling lipid homeostasis between cellular
organelles, Osh4 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Molecular dynamics
simulations were run to examine the interaction between the protein and
membrane models that reflect the lipid diversity of the endoplasmic
reticulum and trans-Golgi membranes. Our study is consistent with
experimental data showing several residues that interact to smaller or
larger extent with the bilayer upon stable binding ({\textasciitilde}200 ns into the
trajectory). We identified PHE239 as a key residue stabilizing the
protein-membrane interaction along with two other binding regions, the
ALPS-like motif and the β6-β7 loops in the mouth region of the protein.

configurational free energies of semiflexible macromolecular systems,
based on the technique of thermodynamic integration combined with
normal-mode analysis of a reference system subject to harmonic
constraints. Compared with previous free-energy calculations that depend
on a reference state, our approach introduces two innovations, namely, the
use of internal coordinates to constrain the reference states and the
ability to freely select these reference states. As a consequence, it is
possible to explore systems that undergo substantially larger fluctuations
than those considered in previous calculations, including semiflexible
biopolymers having arbitrary ratios of contour length L to persistence
length P. To validate the method, high accuracy is demonstrated for free
energies of prime DNA knots with L/P = 20 and L/P = 40, corresponding to
DNA lengths of 3000 and 6000 base pairs, respectively. We then apply the
method to study the free-energy landscape for a model of a synaptic
nucleoprotein complex containing a pair of looped domains, revealing a
bifurcation in the location of optimal synapse (crossover) sites. This
transition is relevant to target-site selection by DNA-binding proteins
that occupy multiple DNA sites separated by large linear distances along
the genome, a problem that arises naturally in gene regulation, DNA
recombination, and the action of type-II topoisomerases.},

explains how macroscopic membrane properties modulate protein recruitment

polysaccharides, but gradually more quantitative image analysis techniques
were developed as the AFM grew easier to use in aqueous liquids and in

and characterize their physicochemical properties by application of
appropriate polymer stretching models, using a technique called
single-molecule force spectroscopy. From application of such models as the
wormlike chain, freely jointed chain, extensible-freely jointed chain,
etc., properties such as the contour length, persistence length and
segment elasticity or spring constant can be calculated for
polysaccharides. The adhesion between polysaccharides and surfaces has
been quantified with AFM, and this application is particularly useful for
studying polysaccharides on microbial and other types of cells, because
their adhesion is controlled by biopolymer characteristics. This review
presents a synthesis of the theory and techniques currently in use to

dynamics, structure, and stability of membrane-protein systems.
Coarse-grained (CG) models, in which small groups of atoms are treated as
single particles, enable extended ({\textgreater}100 ns) timescales to be addressed. In
this study, we explore how CG-MD methods that have been developed for
detergents and lipids may be extended to membrane proteins. In particular,
CG-MD simulations of a number of membrane peptides and proteins are used
to characterize their interactions with lipid bilayers. CG-MD is used to
simulate the insertion of synthetic model membrane peptides (WALPs and
LS3) into a lipid (PC) bilayer. WALP peptides insert in a transmembrane
orientation, whilst the LS3 peptide adopts an interfacial location, both
in agreement with experimental biophysical data. This approach is extended
to a transmembrane fragment of the Vpu protein from HIV-1, and to the coat
protein from fd phage. Again, simulated protein/membrane interactions are
in good agreement with solid state NMR data for these proteins. CG-MD has
also been applied to an M3-M4 fragment from the CFTR protein. Simulations
of CFTR M3-M4 in a detergent micelle reveal formation of an alpha-helical
hairpin, consistent with a variety of biophysical data. In an I231D
mutant, the M3-M4 hairpin is additionally stabilized via an inter-helix
Q207/D231 interaction. Finally, CG-MD simulations are extended to a more
complex membrane protein, the bacterial sugar transporter LacY. Comparison
of a 200 ns CG-MD simulation of LacY in a DPPC bilayer with a 50 ns
atomistic simulation of the same protein in a DMPC bilayer shows that the
two methods yield comparable predictions of lipid-protein interactions.
Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of CG-MD simulations
for studies of membrane/protein interactions.},

mechanical properties of the membrane impact protein association? By using
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we show that increased
surface tension significantly impacts the dynamics of protein assembly.
While tensionless membranes promote a rapid formation of long-living
linear aggregates of N-BAR proteins, increase in tension alters the
geometry of protein association. At high tension, protein interactions are
strongly inhibited. Increasing surface density of proteins leads to a
wider range of protein association geometries, promoting the formation of
meshes, which can be broken apart with membrane tension. Our work
indicates that surface tension may play a key role in recruiting proteins
to membrane-remodelling sites in the cell.},

applications that involve potential contact with cellular membranes. As a
result, it is essential to gain a physical understanding of NP-membrane

can fuse with lipid bilayers after contact between protruding
solvent-exposed lipid tails and the NP monolayer. Fusion was only observed
at the high-curvature edges of large bilayer defects, but not in
low-curvature regions where protrusions are rarely observed. Here, we use
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to show that the same NPs can
also fuse with low-curvature bilayers in the absence of defects if
NP-protrusion contact occurs, generalizing the results of our previous
work. Insertion proceeds without applying biasing forces to the NP, driven
by the hydrophobic effect, and involves the transient generation of
bilayer curvature. We further find that NPs with long hydrophobic ligands
can insert a single ligand into the bilayer core in a manner similar to
the binding of peripheral proteins. Such anchoring may precede insertion,
revealing potential methods for engineering NP monolayers to enhance
NP-bilayer fusion in systems with a low likelihood of lipid tail
protrusions. These results reveal new pathways for NP-bilayer fusion and
provide fundamental insight into behavior at the nano-bio interface.},

function; thus, it is important to develop new methods to simultaneously
determine membrane curvature and protein binding sites in membranes with
multiple curvatures. We introduce solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) methods based on magnetically oriented bicelles and off-magic-angle
spinning (OMAS) to measure membrane curvature and the binding site of
proteins in mixed-curvature membranes. We demonstrate these methods on the
influenza virus M2 protein, which not only acts as a proton channel but
also mediates virus assembly and membrane scission. An M2 peptide
encompassing the transmembrane (TM) domain and an amphipathic helix,
M2(21-61), was studied and compared with the TM peptide (M2TM). Static
(31)P NMR spectra of magnetically oriented
1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DMPC)/1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) bicelles exhibit
a temperature-independent isotropic chemical shift in the presence of
M2(21-61) but not M2TM, indicating that the amphipathic helix confers the
ability to generate a high-curvature phase. Two-dimensional (2D) (31)P
spectra indicate that this high-curvature phase is associated with the
DHPC bicelle edges, suggestive of the structure of budding viruses from
the host cell. (31)P- and (13)C-detected (1)H relaxation times of the
lipids indicate that the majority of M2(21-61) is bound to the
high-curvature phase. Using OMAS experiments, we resolved the (31)P
signals of lipids with identical headgroups based on their distinct
chemical shift anisotropies. On the basis of this resolution, 2D
(1)H-(31)P correlation spectra show that the amide protons in M2(21-61)
correlate with the DMPC but not DHPC (31)P signal of the bicelle,
indicating that a small percentage of M2(21-61) partitions into the planar
region of the bicelles. These results show that the amphipathic helix
induces high membrane curvature and localizes the protein to this phase,
in good agreement with the membrane scission function of the protein.
These bicelle-based relaxation and OMAS solid-state NMR techniques are
generally applicable to curvature-inducing membrane proteins such as those
involved in membrane trafficking, membrane fusion, and cell division.},

	abstract = {The BAR domain superfamily proteins sense or induce curvature in
membranes. The inverse-BAR domain (I-BAR) is a BAR domain that forms a
straight "zeppelin-shaped" dimer. The mechanisms by which IRSp53 I-BAR
binds to and deforms a lipid membrane are investigated here by all-atom
molecular dynamics simulation (MD), binding energy analysis, and the
effects of mutation experiments on filopodia on HeLa cells. I-BAR adopts a
curved structure when crystallized, but adopts a flatter shape in MD. The
binding of I-BAR to membrane was stabilized by {\textasciitilde}30 salt bridges,
consistent with experiments showing that point mutations of the interface
residues have little effect on the binding affinity whereas multiple
mutations have considerable effect. Salt bridge formation increases the
local density of lipids and deforms the membrane into a concave shape. In
addition, the point mutations that break key intra-molecular salt bridges
within I-BAR reduce the binding affinity; this was confirmed by expressing
these mutants in HeLa cells and observing their effects. The results
indicate that the stiffness of I-BAR is important for membrane
deformation, although I-BAR does not act as a completely rigid template.},

influences of lipid-cholesterol interactions on membrane fluctuations are
reviewed in this paper. Emphasis is placed on understanding the energy
landscapes and fluctuations at an emergent atomistic level. Solid-state
(2)H NMR spectroscopy directly measures residual quadrupolar couplings
(RQCs) due to individual C-(2)H labeled segments of the lipid molecules.
Moreover, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) of (13)C-(1)H bonds are
obtained in separated local-field NMR spectroscopy. The distributions of
RQC or RDC values give nearly complete profiles of the order parameters as
a function of acyl segment position. Measured equilibrium properties of
glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids including their binary and tertiary
mixtures with cholesterol show unequal mixing associated with
liquid-ordered domains. The entropic loss upon addition of cholesterol to
sphingolipids is less than for glycerophospholipids and may drive the
formation of lipid rafts. In addition relaxation time measurements enable
one to study the molecular dynamics over a wide time-scale range. For (2)H
NMR the experimental spin-lattice (R1Z) relaxation rates follow a
theoretical square-law dependence on segmental order parameters (SCD) due
to collective slow dynamics over mesoscopic length scales. The functional
dependence for the liquid-crystalline lipid membranes is indicative of
viscoelastic properties as they emerge from atomistic-level interactions.
A striking decrease in square-law slope upon addition of cholesterol
denotes stiffening relative to the pure lipid bilayers that is diminished
in the case of lanosterol. Measured equilibrium properties and relaxation
rates infer opposite influences of cholesterol and detergents on
collective dynamics and elasticity at an atomistic scale that potentially
affects lipid raft formation in cellular membranes.},

large-scale simulations to study the lateral organization and dynamics of

molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied model membranes comprising
∼7000 lipids and 16 identical copies of model cylindrical proteins of
either α-helical or β-barrel types. Through variation of the lipid tail
length and hence the degree of hydrophobic mismatch, our simulations
display levels of protein aggregation ranging from negligible to
extensive. The nature and extent of aggregation are shown to be influenced
by membrane curvature and the shape or orientation of the protein.
Interestingly, a model β-barrel protein aggregates to form one-dimensional
strings within the bilayer plane, whereas a model α-helical bundle forms
two-dimensional clusters. Overall, it is clear that the nature and extent
of membrane protein aggregation is dependent on several aspects of the
proteins and lipids, including hydrophobic mismatch, protein class and

endocytosis, vesiculation and protein sorting, and in the biogenesis of
organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus. It is
well established that the remodelling process is aided by specialized
proteins that can sense as well as create membrane curvature, and trigger
tubulation when added to synthetic liposomes. Because the energy needed
for such large-scale changes in membrane geometry significantly exceeds
the binding energy between individual proteins and between protein and
membrane, cooperative action is essential. It has recently been suggested
that curvature-mediated attractive interactions could aid cooperation and
complement the effects of specific binding events on membrane remodelling.
But it is difficult to experimentally isolate curvature-mediated
interactions from direct attractions between proteins. Moreover,
approximate theories predict repulsion between isotropically curving
proteins. Here we use coarse-grained membrane simulations to show that
curvature-inducing model proteins adsorbed on lipid bilayer membranes can
experience attractive interactions that arise purely as a result of
membrane curvature. We find that once a minimal local bending is realized,
the effect robustly drives protein cluster formation and subsequent
transformation into vesicles with radii that correlate with the local
curvature imprint. Owing to its universal nature, curvature-mediated
attraction can operate even between proteins lacking any specific
interactions, such as newly synthesized and still immature membrane
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.},

engineer and control highly swollen bicontinuous cubic phases of
spacegroup Im3m containing only lipids by (a) increasing the bilayer
stiffness by adding cholesterol and (b) inducing electrostatic repulsion
across the water channels by addition of anionic lipids to monoolein. By
controlling the composition of the ternary mixtures we have been able to
achieve lattice parameters up to 470 Å, which is 5 times that observed in
pure monoolein and nearly twice the size of any lipidic cubic phase
reported previously. These lattice parameters significantly exceed the
predicted maximum swelling for bicontinuous cubic lipid structures, which
suggest that thermal fluctuations should destroy such phases for lattice
parameters larger than 300 Å.},

initiating a number of signaling events on binding and activating its cell

for treating diabetes and to probe the mechanism of interaction of insulin

have been discovered and found to selectively function as agonists and
antagonists, but their structures and the mechanistic details of their
interactions with the receptor remain challenging to characterize. In this
work, we have studied the folding properties and structure of a Site 1
insulin mimetic peptide S371 that has sequence similarities with the
insulin B-chain as well as with a critical hormone-binding element of the
receptor known as the C-terminal (CT) peptide. We first validated our
simulation approaches by predicting the known solution structure of the
insulin B-chain helix and then applied them to study the folding of the
mimetic peptide S371. Our data predict a helical fold for the first 16
residues of S371 that has a resemblance to the helical motifs in the
insulin B-chain and CT. We also propose receptor-bound models of S371 that

bilayers can be experimentally obtained by measuring C-H bond order
parameters, spin relaxation rates and scattering form factors. These
parameters can be also directly calculated from the classical atomistic
resolution molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and compared to the
experimentally achieved results. This comparison measures the simulation
model quality with respect to 'reality'. If agreement is sufficient, the
simulation model gives an atomistic structural interpretation of the
acquired experimental data. Significant advance of MD models is made by
jointly interpreting different experiments using the same structural
model. Here we focus on phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers, which out of
all model membranes have been studied mostly by experiments and
simulations, leading to the largest available dataset. From the applied
comparisons we conclude that the acyl chain region structure and
rotational dynamics are generally well described in simulation models.
Also changes with temperature, dehydration and cholesterol concentration
are qualitatively correctly reproduced. However, the quality of the
underlying atomistic resolution structural changes is uncertain. Even
worse, when focusing on the lipid bilayer properties at the interfacial
region, e.g. glycerol backbone and choline structures, and cation binding,
many simulation models produce an inaccurate description of experimental
data. Thus extreme care must be applied when simulations are applied to
understand phenomena where the interfacial region plays a significant

vesicle/membrane deformation with an apparently new coarse-grained model
of the SNARE complex. The coarse-grained model of the SNARE complex is
calibrated by comparison with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations as
well as by force measurements in laser tweezer experiments. The model for
vesicle/membrane interactions includes the forces produced by membrane
deformation and hydration or electrostatic repulsion. Combining these two
parts, the coarse-grained model of the SNARE complex with membrane
mechanics, we study how the equilibrium docked state varies with the
number of SNARE complexes. We find that a single SNARE complex is able to
bring a typical synaptic vesicle to within a distance of ∼ 3 nm from the

an overdocked state of {\textgreater}4-6 SNAREs actually increases the equilibrium

signaling complexes in defined membrane compartments. The number of
protein modules that are known to recognise these membrane lipids is
rapidly increasing. Pleckstrin homology domains, FYVE domains, PX domains,
ENTH domains, CALM domains, PDZ domains, PTB domains and FERM domains are
all inositide-recognition modules. The latest additions to this list are
members of the clathrin adaptor protein and arrestin families. Initially,
inositol lipids were believed to recruit signaling molecules to specific
membrane compartments, but many of the domains clearly do not possess high
enough affinity to act alone as localisation signals. Another important
notion is that some (and probably most) of these protein modules also have
protein binding partners, and their protein- and lipid-binding activities
might influence one another through allosteric mechanisms. Comparison of
the structural features of these domains not only reveals a high degree of
conservation of their lipid interaction sites but also highlights their
evolutionary link to protein modules known for protein-protein
interactions. Protein-protein interactions involving lipid-binding domains
could serve as the basis for phosphoinositide-induced conformational
regulation of target proteins at biological membranes. Therefore, these
modules function as crucially important signal integrators, which explains
their involvement in a broad range of regulatory functions in eukaryotic

simulations of finer-grained (e.g., all-atom) models, for example the

single effective CG particles. This is accomplished by augmenting existing
effective particle CG schemes to allow for discrete state transitions and
configuration-dependent resolution. Additionally, certain conclusions of
this work connect back to single-state force matching and open up new
avenues for method development in that area. These results provide a
formal statistical mechanical basis for UCG methods related to force
matching and relative entropy CG methods and suggest practical algorithms
for constructing optimal approximate UCG models from fine-grained

curvature. This phenomenon has been observed in biological processes such
as endocytosis, tubulation, and vesiculation. However, it is not clear how
the local surface properties of the membrane, such as membrane tension,
change in response to protein adsorption. In this article, we show that
the partial differential equations arising from classical elastic model of
lipid membranes, which account for simultaneous changes in shape and
membrane tension due to protein adsorption in a local region, cannot be
solved for nonaxisymmetric geometries using straightforward numerical
techniques; instead, a viscous-elastic formulation is necessary to fully
describe the system. Therefore, we develop a viscous-elastic model for
inhomogeneous membranes of the Helfrich type. Using the newly available
viscous-elastic model, we find that the lipids flow to accommodate changes
in membrane curvature during protein adsorption. We show that, at the end
of protein adsorption process, the system sustains a residual local
tension to balance the difference between the actual mean curvature and
the imposed spontaneous curvature. We also show that this change in
membrane tension can have a functional impact such as altered response to
pulling forces in the presence of proteins.},

understanding of biomolecular interactions at an atomic level. This in
turn has allowed molecular simulation methods employing full atomistic
modelling at ever larger scales to develop. However, some challenging
areas still remain where there is either a lack of atomic resolution
structures or where the simulation system is inherently complex. An area
where both challenges are present is that of membranes containing membrane
proteins. In this review we analyse a new practical approach to membrane
protein study that offers a potential new route to high resolution
structures and the possibility to simplify simulations. These new
approaches collectively recognise that preservation of the interaction
between the membrane protein and the lipid bilayer is often essential to
maintain structure and function. The new methods preserve these
interactions by producing nano-scale disc shaped particles that include
bilayer and the chosen protein. Currently two approaches lead in this
area: the MSP system that relies on peptides to stabilise the discs, and
SMALPs where an amphipathic styrene maleic acid copolymer is used. Both
methods greatly enable protein production and hence have the potential to
accelerate atomic resolution structure determination as well as providing
a simplified format for simulations of membrane protein dynamics. This

inhomogeneously, but neither the scale at which relevant variation takes
place nor the effect of varying lipid composition or tension has yet been
investigated in atomic detail. We calculated lateral pressure profile
distributions in lipid bilayers of various composition from all-atom
molecular dynamics simulations totaling 110.5 ns in length. Reproducible
pressure profile features at the 1 A length scale were determined. Lipids
with phosphatidylcholine headgroups were found to shift the lateral
pressure out of the hydrophobic core and into the headgroup region by an
amount that is independent of area per lipid. POPE bilayers simulated at
areas smaller than optimal exerted dramatically higher lateral pressure in
a narrow region at the start of the aliphatic chain. Stretching of POPC
bilayers increased tension predominantly in the same region. A simple
geometric analysis for the gating of the mechanosensitive channel MscL

for transbilayer coupling. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of
asymmetric multicomponent-membrane bilayers in a mixed phase provide
evidence that immobilization of long saturated acyl-chain lipids at either

local domains with characteristics similar to a liquid-ordered (lo) phase.
This is verified by experiments wherein immobilization of long acyl-chain
lipids at one leaflet effects transbilayer interactions of corresponding

recognized as an important factor in remodeling of biological membranes,
for example during transport vesicle formation. In this paper, we
theoretically analyze the effect of protein crowding on membrane bending
and examine its dependence on protein size, shape, transmembrane asymmetry
and lateral confinement. We consider three scenarios of protein lateral
organization, which are highly relevant for cellular membranes in general:
freely diffusing membrane proteins without lateral confinement, the
presence of a diffusion barrier and interactions with a vesicular coat. We
show that protein crowding affects vesicle formation even if the proteins
are distributed symmetrically across the membrane and that this effect
depends significantly on lateral confinement. The largest crowding effect
is predicted for the proteins that are confined to the forming vesicle by
a diffusion barrier. We calculate the bending properties of a crowded
membrane and find that its spontaneous curvature depends primarily on the
degree of transmembrane asymmetry, and its effective bending modulus on
the type of lateral confinement. Using the example of COPII vesicle
formation from the endoplasmic reticulum, we analyze the energetic cost of
vesicle formation. The results provide a novel insight into the effects of
lateral and transmembrane organization of membrane proteins, and can guide
data interpretation and future experimental approaches.},

membranes, both cell membranes and membranes of enveloped viruses. How
these two classes of membrane components interact with each other to
influence the function of biological membranes is a fundamental question
that has attracted intense interest since the origins of the field of
membrane studies. One of the most powerful ideas that driven the field is
the likelihood that lipids bind to membrane proteins at specific sites,
modulating protein structure and function. However only relatively
recently has high resolution structure determination of membrane proteins
progressed to the point of providing atomic level structure of lipid
binding sites on membrane proteins. Analysis of X-ray diffraction,
electron crystallography and NMR data over 100 specific lipid binding
sites on membrane proteins. These data demonstrate tight lipid binding of
both phospholipids and cholesterol to membrane proteins. Membrane lipids
bind to membrane proteins by their headgroups, or by their acyl chains, or
binding is mediated by the entire lipid molecule. When headgroups bind,
binding is stabilized by polar interactions between lipid headgroups and
the protein. When acyl chains bind, van der Waals effects dominate as the
acyl chains adopt conformations that complement particular sites on the
rough protein surface. No generally applicable motifs for binding have yet
emerged. Previously published biochemical and biophysical data link this

epidermal growth factor receptor (HER3/ERBB3) and its catalytically active

outcomes through mechanisms that remain largely unknown. We used
stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) with pair-correlation
analysis to show that EGF and neuregulin (NRG) can induce different
extents of HER3 clustering that are dependent on the nature of the
coexpressed HER receptor. We found that the presence of these clusters
correlated with distinct patterns and mechanisms of receptor
phosphorylation. NRG induction of HER3 phosphorylation depended on the
formation of the asymmetric kinase dimer with EGFR in the absence of
detectable higher-order oligomers. Upon EGF stimulation, HER3 paralleled
previously observed EGFR behavior and formed large clusters within which
HER3 was phosphorylated via a noncanonical mechanism. HER3 phosphorylation
by HER2 in the presence of NRG proceeded through still another mechanism
and involved the formation of clusters within which receptor
phosphorylation depended on asymmetric kinase dimerization. Our results
demonstrate that the higher-order organization of HER receptors is an
essential feature of their ligand-induced behavior and plays an essential
role in lateral cross-activation of the receptors. We also show that HER

continuous functional forms for thermal undulation and peristaltic

relationships between these curves. Undulation and peristaltic spectra
display excellent agreement with data from both atomistic and

model accurately predicts the bilayer's response to a cylindrical protein
inclusion as observed in coarse-grained simulation. This elastic response
provides an explanation for gramicidin ion channel lifetime versus
membrane thickness data that requires no fit constants. The physical
parameters inherent to this picture may be expressed in terms of familiar
material properties associated with lipid monolayers. Inclusion of a
finite monolayer spontaneous curvature is essential to obtain fully

	abstract = {Gramicidin A (gA) is a 15-amino-acid antibiotic peptide with an
alternating L-D sequence, which forms (dimeric) bilayer-spanning,
monovalent cation channels in biological membranes and synthetic bilayers.
We performed molecular dynamics simulations of gA dimers and monomers in
all-atom, explicit dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC),
dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC),
and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers. The
variation in acyl chain length among these different phospholipids
provides a way to alter gA-bilayer interactions by varying the bilayer
hydrophobic thickness, and to determine the influence of hydrophobic
mismatch on the structure and dynamics of both gA channels (and monomeric
subunits) and the host bilayers. The simulations show that the channel
structure varied little with changes in hydrophobic mismatch, and that the
lipid bilayer adapts to the bilayer-spanning channel to minimize the
exposure of hydrophobic residues. The bilayer thickness, however, did not
vary monotonically as a function of radial distance from the channel. In
all simulations, there was an initial decrease in thickness within 4-5 Å
from the channel, which was followed by an increase in DOPC and POPC or a
further decrease in DLPC and DMPC bilayers. The bilayer thickness varied
little in the monomer simulations-except one of three independent
simulations for DMPC and all three DLPC simulations, where the bilayer
thinned to allow a single subunit to form a bilayer-spanning
water-permeable pore. The radial dependence of local lipid area and
bilayer compressibility is also nonmonotonic in the first shell around gA
dimers due to gA-phospholipid interactions and the hydrophobic mismatch.
Order parameters, acyl chain dynamics, and diffusion constants also differ
between the lipids in the first shell and the bulk. The lipid behaviors in
the first shell around gA dimers are more complex than predicted from a
simple mismatch model, which has implications for understanding the
energetics of membrane protein-lipid interactions.},

long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These phenomena include the

Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be
run on length and time scales that are 2-3 orders of magnitude larger
compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between the
atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG model for
proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field. Here, we validate the
model for its use in peptide-bilayer systems. In order to validate the
model, we calculated the potential of mean force for each amino acid as a
function of its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
(DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association constants,
the partitioning of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and
orientation of WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides
in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) bilayers. A comparison with results obtained from atomistic models
shows good agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a
systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of
polyalanine-leucine peptides (with different lengths and compositions) in
DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of peptides partitioned at the
interface increased with decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine
content, demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating
partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the amino acid
composition. Finally, we simulated the concentration-dependent formation
of transmembrane pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with
atomistic simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In
conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and effectively
reproduces peptide-lipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids

endocytic adaptor proteins, Epsin1 and AP180 are highly potent drivers of
membrane curvature. This result is unexpected since intrinsically
disordered domains lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure.
However, in vitro measurements of membrane curvature and protein
diffusivity demonstrate that the large hydrodynamic radii of these domains
generate steric pressure that drives membrane bending. When disordered
adaptor domains are expressed as transmembrane cargo in mammalian cells,
they are excluded from clathrin-coated pits. We propose that a balance of
steric pressure on the two surfaces of the membrane drives this exclusion.

asymmetric incorporation of LPC can lead to significant curvature in a

(pressure profile) of the resulting mound structure indicates that the
degree of pressure profile perturbation is determined not by the local
curvature per se but by the packing of lipid headgroups (i.e.,
area-per-lipid). The findings help provide a concrete basis for
understanding the activation mechanism of mechanosensitive channels by
asymmetric incorporation of LPC into membrane patches in patch-clamp

varying systematically the length of the peptide (KALP15, KALP19, KALP23,

DPPC), a wide range of mismatch conditions were studied. Simulations of
durations of 50-200 ns show that under positive mismatch, the system
alleviates the mismatch predominantly by tilting the peptide and to a
smaller extent by increased lipid ordering in the immediate vicinity of
the peptide. Under negative mismatch, alleviation takes place by a
combination of local bilayer bending and the snorkeling of the lysine
residues of the peptide. Simulations performed at a higher peptide/lipid
molar ratio (1:25) reveal slower dynamics of both the peptide and lipid
relative to those at a lower peptide/lipid ratio (1:128). The lysine

receptors including the insulin receptor (IR) and type 1 insulin-like
growth factor receptor (IGF1R) that are constitutively homodimeric

ligand-triggered domain rearrangements rather than receptor dimerization
for activation. Specifically, binding of peptide ligands to receptor
ectodomains transduces signals across the transmembrane domains for
trans-autophosphorylation in cytoplasmic kinase domains. The molecular
details of these processes are poorly understood in part due to the
absence of structures of full-length receptors. Using MD simulations and
enhanced conformational sampling algorithms, we present all-atom
structural models of peptides containing 51 residues from the
transmembrane and juxtamembrane regions of IR and IGF1R. In our models,
the transmembrane regions of both receptors adopt helical conformations
with kinks at Pro961 (IR) and Pro941 (IGF1R), but the C-terminal residues
corresponding to the juxtamembrane region of each receptor adopt unfolded
and flexible conformations in IR as opposed to a helix in IGF1R. We also
observe that the N-terminal residues in IR form a kinked-helix sitting at
the membrane-solvent interface, while homologous residues in IGF1R are
unfolded and flexible. These conformational differences result in a larger
tilt-angle of the membrane-embedded helix in IGF1R in comparison to IR to
compensate for interactions with water molecules at the membrane-solvent
interfaces. Our metastable/stable states for the transmembrane domain of
IR, observed in a lipid bilayer, are consistent with a known NMR structure
of this domain determined in detergent micelles, and similar states in
IGF1R are consistent with a previously reported model of the dimerized
transmembrane domains of IGF1R. Our all-atom structural models suggest
potentially unique structural organization of kinase domains in each

sensitive membrane curvature sensors, the Amphipathic Lipid Packing Sensor

membranes per se; rather, it recognizes defects in lipid packing that
arise from membrane bending. In a companion paper, we show that these
defects can be mimicked by introducing conical lipids in a flat lipid
bilayer, in agreement with experimental observations. Here, we use
molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize ALPS binding to such
lipid bilayers. The ALPS motif recognizes lipid-packing defects by a
conserved mechanism: peptide partitioning is driven by the insertion of
hydrophobic residues into large packing defects that are preformed in the
bilayer. This insertion induces only minor modifications in the
statistical distribution of the free packing defects. ALPS insertion is
severely hampered when monounsaturated lipids are replaced by saturated
lipids, leading to a decrease in packing defects. We propose that the
hypersensitivity of ALPS motifs to lipid packing defects results from the
repetitive use of hydrophobic insertions along the monotonous ALPS

scales reachable by MD simulations to match those attainable by several
accurate experimental techniques. However, until recently, the quality and
maturity of software tools available for building membrane models for
simulations as well as analyzing the results of these simulations have
seriously lagged behind. Here, we discuss the recent developments of such
tools from the end-users' point of view. In particular, we review the
software that can be employed to build lipid bilayers and other related
structures with or without embedded membrane proteins to be employed in MD
simulations. Additionally, we provide a brief critical insight into force
fields and MD packages commonly used for membrane and membrane protein
simulations. Finally, we list analysis tools that can be used to study the
properties of membrane and membrane protein systems. In all these points
we comment on the respective compatibility of the covered tools. We also
share our opinion on the current state of the available software. We
briefly discuss the most commonly employed tools and platforms on which
new software can be built. We conclude the review by providing a few ideas
and guidelines on how the development of tools can be further boosted to
catch up with the rapid pace at which the field of membrane simulation
progresses. This includes improving the compatibility between software
tools and promoting the openness of the codes on which these applications
rely. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Biosimulations

bilayers and micelles played a strong role in the development and testing
of the force field parameters. Most previous force fields for
sphingomyelins were developed before the availability of the detailed NMR
data and relied on x-ray diffraction of bilayers alone for the validation;
these are shown to be too dense in the bilayer plane based on published
chain order parameter data from simulations and experiments. The present
simulations reveal O-H:::O-P intralipid hydrogen bonding occurs 99\% of the
time, and interlipid N-H:::O=C (26-29\%, depending on the lipid) and
N-H:::O-H (17-19\%). The interlipid hydrogen bonds are long lived, showing
decay times of 50 ns, and forming strings of lipids, and leading to
reorientational correlation time of nearly 100 ns. The spontaneous radius
of curvature for pure N-palmitoyl sphingomyelin bilayers is estimated to
be 43-100 Å, depending on the assumptions made in assigning a bending

repeatedly over the years, controlled experimental investigations have
proven elusive. Here, we introduce an experimental platform, in which
microfabricated surfaces impose specific curvature patterns onto lipid

membranes. We find that, beyond a critical curvature value, membrane
geometry governs the spatial ordering of phase-separated domain structures
in membranes composed of cholesterol and phospholipids. The
curvature-controlled ordering, a consequence of the distinct mechanical
properties of the lipid phases, makes possible a determination of the
bending rigidity difference between cholesterol-rich and cholesterol-poor
lipid domains. These observations point to a strong coupling between
mechanical bending and chemical organization that should have
wide-reaching consequences for biological membranes. Curvature-mediated
patterning may also be useful in controlling complex fluids other than

in a membrane is sensitive to the lipid head group packing and can report
qualitatively on membrane lateral compression near the aqueous interface.
We have used high-resolution (31)P-nuclear magnetic resonance to evaluate
the lateral compression on each side of asymmetrical lipid vesicles. When
monooleoylphosphatidylcholine was added to the external monolayer of
sonicated vesicles containing dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and
dioleoylphosphatidic acid, the variation of (31)P chemical shift of
phosphatidic acid indicated a lateral compression in the external
monolayer. Simultaneously, a slight dilation was observed in the inner
monolayer. In large unilamellar vesicles on the other hand the lateral
pressure increased in both monolayers after asymmetrical insertion of
monooleoylphosphatidylcholine. This can be explained by assuming that when
monooleoylphosphatidylcholine is added to large unilamellar vesicles, the
membrane bends until the strain is the same in both monolayers. In the
case of sonicated vesicles, a change of curvature is not possible, and
therefore differential packing in the two layers remains. We infer that a
variation of lipid asymmetry by generating a lateral strain in the
membrane can be a physiological way of modulating the conformation of
membrane proteins.},

membrane cholesterol by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbCD) resulted in a
disruption of lipid rafts in plasma membrane as it was revealed by
fluorescent labelling of GM1 ganglioside. In normal fibroblasts with
highly developed microfilament system, the cholesterol depletion resulted
in actin disassembly and reduction of stress fibres. However, in
transformed cells containing low amount of fibrillar actin, MbCD treatment
induced intensive formation of stress fibres and increased cell spreading.
The results show that the effect of cholesterol depletion and lipid raft
disruption on microfilament system is critically determined by the initial
state of cytoskeleton, specifically, by the balance of polymerised and
monomeric actin in the cell. We assume that uncapping of the
microfilaments is the key step of cholesterol-regulated actin remodelling.},

[PI(4,5)P2], regulate the activities of many actin-binding proteins
(ABPs), including profilin, cofilin, Dia2, N-WASP, ezrin, and moesin, but
the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. Moreover,
because of a lack of available methodology, the dynamics of membrane
interactions have not been experimentally determined for any ABP. Here, we
applied a combination of biochemical assays, photobleaching/activation
approaches, and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to uncover the
molecular principles by which ABPs interact with phosphoinositide-rich
membranes. We show that, despite using different domains for lipid
binding, these proteins associate with membranes through similar
multivalent electrostatic interactions, without specific binding pockets
or penetration into the lipid bilayer. Strikingly, our experiments reveal
that these proteins display enormous differences in the dynamics of
membrane interactions and in the ranges of phosphoinositide densities that
they sense. Profilin and cofilin display transient, low-affinity
interactions with phosphoinositide-rich membranes, whereas F-actin
assembly factors Dia2 and N-WASP reside on phosphoinositide-rich membranes
for longer periods to perform their functions. Ezrin and moesin, which
link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, bind membranes with
very high affinity and slow dissociation dynamics. Unlike profilin,
cofilin, Dia2, and N-WASP, they do not require high "stimulus-responsive"
phosphoinositide density for membrane binding. Moreover, ezrin can limit
the lateral diffusion of PI(4,5)P2 along the lipid bilayer. Together,
these findings demonstrate that membrane-interaction mechanisms of ABPs

fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally enriched and colocalizes spatially and
temporally with the F-actin focus that defines the fusion site. PI(4,5)P2
enrichment depends on receptor engagement but is upstream or parallel to
actin remodeling. Regulators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with
PI(4,5)P2 in vivo and bind PI(4,5)P2 in vitro. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2
availability leads to impaired fusion, with a reduction in the F-actin
focus size and altered focus morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in
the actin focus are due to a failure in the enrichment of actin regulators
at the fusion site. Moreover, improper localization of these regulators
hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 enrichment at
the fusion site encodes spatial and temporal information that regulates
fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Although p16 protein expression, a surrogate marker of oncogenic
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is recognized as a prognostic marker
in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), its prevalence and
significance have not been well established in cancer of the oral cavity,
hypopharynx, or larynx, collectively referred as non-OPSCC, where HPV
infection is less common than in the oropharynx. PATIENTS AND METHODS: p16
expression and high-risk HPV status in non-OPSCCs from RTOG 0129, 0234,
and 0522 studies were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ
hybridization (ISH). Hazard ratios from Cox models were expressed as
positive or negative, stratified by trial, and adjusted for clinical
characteristics. RESULTS: p16 expression was positive in 14.1\% (12 of 85),
24.2\% (23 of 95), and 19.0\% (27 of 142) and HPV ISH was positive in 6.5\%
(six of 93), 14.6\% (15 of 103), and 6.9\% (seven of 101) of non-OPSCCs from
RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522 studies, respectively. Hazard ratios for p16
expression were 0.63 (95\% CI, 0.42 to 0.95; P = .03) and 0.56 (95\% CI,
0.35 to 0.89; P = .01) for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival
(OS), respectively. Comparing OPSCC and non-OPSCC, patients with
p16-positive OPSCC have better PFS and OS than patients with p16-positive
non-OPSCC, but patients with p16-negative OPSCC and non-OPSCC have similar
outcomes. CONCLUSION: Similar to results in patients with OPSCC, patients
with p16-negative non-OPSCC have worse outcomes than patients with
p16-positive non-OPSCC, and HPV may also have a role in outcome in a
subset of non-OPSCC. However, further development of a p16 IHC scoring
system in non-OPSCC and improvement of HPV detection methods are warranted
before broad application in the clinical setting.},

unexplained. In this work, we have exchanged different segments of the

temperature activation. A chimera in which the proximal part of the
C-terminal of TRPV1 replaces an equivalent section of TRPM8 C-terminal is
activated by PIP2 and confers the phenotype of heat activation. PIP2, but
not temperature sensitivity, disappears when positively charged residues
contained in the exchanged region are neutralized. Shortening the
exchanged segment to a length of 11 aa produces voltage-dependent and
temperature-insensitive channels. Our findings suggest the existence of
different activation domains for temperature, PIP2, and voltage. We
provide an interpretation for channel-PIP2 interaction using a full-atom

with the intent of developing transferable neural network potentials that

molecular representation. AEVs provide the ability to train neural
networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space,
a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build
a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB
databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for
organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an
accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential
surfaces, we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for
generating molecular conformations. Through a series of case studies, we
show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT
calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those

simultaneous and coupled simulation of signalling and tissue dynamics. A
cellular resolution of the tissue domain is important to adequately
describe the impact of cell-based events, such as cell division, cell-cell

cell-based mechano-regulatory simulation tool is therefore required.
RESULTS: We developed an open-source software framework for morphogenetic
problems. The environment offers core functionalities for the tissue and
signalling models. In addition, the software offers great flexibility to
add custom extensions and biologically motivated processes. Cells are
represented as highly resolved, massless elastic polygons; the viscous
properties of the tissue are modelled by a Newtonian fluid. The Immersed
Boundary method is used to model the interaction between the viscous and
elastic properties of the cells, thus extending on the IBCell model. The
fluid and signalling processes are solved using the Lattice Boltzmann
method. As application examples we simulate signalling-dependent tissue
dynamics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The documentation and source

forces operate and how they are balanced for stabilizing membrane
proteins. Studying this problem is not a trivial task mainly because of
the methodological challenges in controlling the reversible folding of
membrane proteins in the lipid bilayer. Overcoming the hurdles, meaningful
progress has been made in the field in the last few decades. This review

single lipid property, a correlation length that is determined by the
ratio of the thickness compressibility and bending moduli. The solutions
decay in a non-monotonic fashion with one single observable minimum. A
solution for planar geometry may either be explicitly constructed or
obtained by letting the radius of the cylinder go to infinity. In
dimensionless units the initial derivative of the thickness profile is
universal and equal to -1/√2. In physical units, the derivative depends on
the size of the hydrophobic mismatch as well as the membrane correlation
length and will usually be fairly small but clearly non-zero. The line
tension between the protein inclusion and a fluid phase membrane will
depend on the hydrophobic mismatch and be of the order of 10 pN (larger
for the gel phase). This results in free energy costs for the inclusion
that will be up to tens of kJ/mol (in the fluid phase).},

of them being characterized only by low-resolution information. Visiting
all conformations is a demanding task for computational techniques
performing enhanced but unfocused exploration of collective variable (CV)
space. Otherwise, pulling a structure toward a target condition biases the
exploration in a way difficult to assess. To address this problem, we
introduce here the soft-ratcheting temperature-accelerated molecular
dynamics (sr-TAMD), where the exploration of CV space by TAMD is coupled
to a soft-ratcheting algorithm that filters the evolving CV values
according to a predefined criterion. Any low resolution or even
qualitative information can be used to orient the exploration. We validate
this technique by exploring the conformational space of the inactive state
of the catalytic domain of the adenyl cyclase AC from Bordetella
pertussis. The domain AC gets activated by association with calmodulin
(CaM), and the available crystal structure shows that in the complex the
protein has an elongated shape. High-resolution data are not available for
the inactive, CaM-free protein state, but hydrodynamic measurements have
shown that the inactive AC displays a more globular conformation. Here,
using as CVs several geometric centers, we use sr-TAMD to enhance CV space
sampling while filtering for CV values that correspond to centers moving
close to each other, and we thus rapidly visit regions of conformational
space that correspond to globular structures. The set of conformations
sampled using sr-TAMD provides the most extensive description of the
inactive state of AC up to now, consistent with available experimental

	abstract = {Dok7 is a peripheral membrane protein that is associated with the MuSK
receptor tyrosine kinase. Formation of the Dok7/MuSK/membrane complex is
required for the activation of MuSK. This is a key step in the complex
exchange of signals between neuron and muscle, which lead to neuromuscular
junction formation, dysfunction of which is associated with congenital
myasthenic syndromes. The Dok7 structure consists of a Pleckstrin Homology
(PH) domain and a Phosphotyrosine Binding (PTB) domain. The mechanism of
the Dok7 association with the membrane remains largely unknown. Using
multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations we have explored the formation
of the Dok7 PH/membrane complex. Our simulations indicate that the PH
domain of Dok7 associates with membranes containing phosphatidylinositol
phosphates (PIPs) via interactions of the β1/β2, β3/β4, and β5/β6 loops,
which together form a positively charged surface on the PH domain and
interact with the negatively charged headgroups of PIP molecules. The
initial encounter of the Dok7 PH domain is followed by formation of
additional interactions with the lipid bilayer, and especially with PIP
molecules, which stabilizes the Dok7 PH/membrane complex. We have
quantified the binding of the PH domain to the model bilayers by
calculating a density landscape for protein/membrane interactions.
Detailed analysis of the PH/PIP interactions reveal both a canonical and
an atypical site to be occupied by the anionic lipid. PH domain binding
leads to local clustering of PIP molecules in the bilayer. Association of
the Dok7 PH domain with PIP lipids is therefore seen as a key step in
localization of Dok7 to the membrane and formation of a complex with MuSK.},

loss-of-function mutations in PTEN that impair lipid phosphatase activity

variety of cancers, but information about the membrane-associated state of
PTEN remains sparse. We have modeled a membrane-associated state of the
truncated PTEN structure bound to PI(3,4,5)P3 via multiscale molecular

lipid composition. The level of membrane interaction is substantially
reduced in the phosphatase domain for the triple mutant R161E/K163E/K164E,
in line with experimental results. We observe clustering of anionic lipids
around the C2 domain in preference to the phosphatase domain, suggesting
that the C2 domain is involved in nonspecific interactions with negatively

oncogenicity of the R335L mutation may be due to a reduction in the

advances. New analytical procedures in terms of conformational ensembles

structural, or single-molecule resolution, and combined thermodynamic and
kinetic analysis of fast folding have contributed to demonstrate a general
scenario of limited cooperativity in folding. Gradual structural disorder
is already apparent on the unfolded and native states of slow, two-state
folding proteins, and it greatly increases in magnitude for fast folding
domains. These results demonstrate a direct link between how fast a
single-domain protein folds and unfolds, and how cooperative (or
structurally diverse) is its equilibrium unfolding process. Reducing
cooperativity also destabilizes the native structure because it affects
unfolding more than folding. We can thus define a continuous cooperativity
scale that goes from the 'pliable' two-state character of slow folders to
the gradual unfolding of one-state downhill, and eventually to
intrinsically disordered proteins. The connection between gradual
unfolding and intrinsic disorder is appealing because it suggests a
conformational rheostat mechanism to explain the allosteric effects of
folding coupled to binding.},

the time-dependence of hydrodynamic interactions between finite-sized

Navier-Stokes equation. The theoretical results show that at high
frequencies, the compressibility of the fluid has a significant impact on
the frequency-dependent pair interactions. The predictions of hydrodynamic
theory are compared to molecular dynamics simulations of two nanocolloids

by extending the inverse Volterra technique. The simulation data agree
very well with the theory, therefore, the theory can be used to implement
dynamically consistent hydrodynamic interactions in the increasingly

Different popular protein models are considered and compared with each

membrane are manipulated by applying different tensions. The response of
the membrane to the insertion of single proteins is found to be mostly
generic and independent of the choice of the protein model. Likewise, the
orientational distributions of single proteins depend mainly on the
hydrophobic mismatch and the hydrophobicity of the proteins, and are
otherwise similar for all protein models. Orientational distributions are
generally found to be very broad, i.e. tilt angles fluctuate very much, in
agreement with experimental findings. Weakly hydrophobic proteins respond
to positive hydrophobic mismatch by tilting. Strongly hydrophobic
(strongly bound) proteins distort the surrounding membrane and tend to
remain upright. For proteins with intermediate hydrophobicity, the two
mechanisms compete, and as a result, the tilt only sets in if the
hydrophobic mismatch exceeds a threshold. Clusters of several strongly
hydrophobic proteins with negative positive mismatch may nucleate
raft-like structures in membranes. This effect is more pronounced for
proteins with rough, structured surfaces.},

certain coercivity property of the least square functional, defined by the
majorization of an L2-norm discrepancy to the kernel with respect to a

study, we found that myo1c can power actin motility on fluid membranes

motility is inhibited by high concentrations of anionic phospholipids.
Strikingly, this motility occurs along curved paths in a counterclockwise
direction (i.e., the actin filaments turn in leftward circles). A
biotinylated myo1c construct containing only the motor domain and the
lever arm anchored via streptavidin on a membrane containing biotinylated
lipid can also generate asymmetric motility, suggesting that the tail
domain is not required for the counterclockwise turning. We found that the
ability to produce counterclockwise motility is not a universal
characteristic of myosin-I motors, as membrane-bound myosin-Ia (myo1a) and
myosin-Ib (myo1b) are able to power actin gliding, but the actin gliding

crucial roles in cell motility and tissue development through interactions
with cytoskeletal effectors and regulation of capping protein at the
leading edge. However, the mechanism of CARMIL leading edge localization
is unknown. Here we show that CARMIL interacts directly with the plasma
membrane through its amino-terminal region. The crystal structure of
CARMIL1-668 reveals that this region harbours a non-canonical pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain connected to a 16-leucine-rich repeat domain. Lipid
binding is mediated by the PH domain, but is further enhanced by a central
helical domain. Small-angle X-ray scattering reveals that the helical
domain mediates antiparallel dimerization, properly positioning the PH
domains for simultaneous membrane interaction. In cells, deletion of the
PH domain impairs leading edge localization. The results support a direct
membrane-binding mechanism for CARMIL localization at the leading edge,
where it regulates cytoskeletal effectors and motility.},

a bin/amphiphysin/rvs (BAR) domain protein that induces vesicle formation

Using site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy, we show that the
overall BAR domain structure of the rat endophilin A1 dimer determined
crystallographically is maintained under predominantly vesiculating
conditions. Spin-labeled side chains on the concave surface of the BAR
domain do not penetrate into the acyl chain interior, indicating that the
BAR domain interacts only peripherally with the surface of a curved
bilayer. Using a combination of EPR data and computational refinement, we
determined the structure of residues 63-86, a region that is disordered in
the crystal structure of rat endophilin A1. Upon membrane binding,
residues 63-75 in each subunit of the endophilin dimer form a slightly
tilted, amphipathic alpha-helix that directly interacts with the membrane.
In their predominant conformation, these helices are located orthogonal to
the long axis of the BAR domain. In this conformation, the amphipathic
helices are positioned to act as molecular wedges that induce membrane
curvature along the concave surface of the BAR domain.},

shall consider sets that are locally well-approximated by k-dimensional

D-dimensional noise. Certain tools from multiscale geometric measure
theory and harmonic analysis seem well-suited to be adapted to the study
of samples from such probability distributions, in order to yield
quantitative geometric information about them. In this paper we introduce
and study multiscale covariance matrices, i.e. covariances corresponding
to the distribution restricted to a ball of radius r, with a fixed center
and varying r, and under rather general geometric assumptions we study how
their empirical, noisy counterparts behave. We prove that in the range of
scales where these covariance matrices are most informative, the
empirical, noisy covariances are close to their expected, noiseless
counterparts. In fact, this is true as soon as the number of samples in
the balls where the covariance matrices are computed is linear in the
intrinsic dimension of M. As an application, we present an algorithm for
estimating the intrinsic dimension of M.},

cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and aberrant EGFR
signaling is implicated in a variety of cancers. EGFR signaling is
triggered by extracellular ligand binding, which promotes EGFR
dimerization and activation. Ligand-binding measurements are consistent
with a negatively cooperative model in which the ligand-binding affinity
at either binding site in an EGFR dimer is weaker when the other site is
occupied by a ligand. This cooperativity is widely believed to be central
to the effects of ligand concentration on EGFR-mediated intracellular
signaling. Although the extracellular portion of the human EGFR dimer has
been resolved crystallographically, the crystal structures do not reveal
the structural origin of this negative cooperativity, which has remained
unclear. Here we report the results of molecular dynamics simulations
suggesting that asymmetrical interactions of the two binding sites with
the membrane may be responsible (perhaps along with other factors) for
this negative cooperativity. In particular, in our simulations the
extracellular domains of an EGFR dimer spontaneously lay down on the
membrane in an orientation in which favorable membrane contacts were made
with one of the bound ligands, but could not be made with the other.
Similar interactions were observed when EGFR was glycosylated, as it is in

membrane curvature. Characterization of members of the three BAR domain

Mutagenesis on BAR domains showed that membrane curvature sensing
critically depends on the N-terminal AH and furthermore that BAR domains
sense membrane curvature through hydrophobic insertion in lipid packing
defects and not through electrostatics. Consequently, amphipathic motifs,
such as AHs, that are often associated with BAR domains emerge as an
important means for a protein to sense membrane curvature. Measurements on
single liposomes allowed us to document heterogeneous binding behaviour

proteins that interact with phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) molecules

role in biological reactions on membrane surfaces. Although diffusivity
can be estimated by long-time measurements, it lacks information on the
short-time diffusive nature. We reveal two diffusive properties of a PH
domain bound to the surface of a PIP-containing membrane using molecular
dynamics simulations. One is fractional Brownian motion, attributed to the
motion of the lipids with which the PH domain interacts. The other is
temporally fluctuating diffusivity; that is, the short-time diffusivity of
the bound protein changes substantially with time. Moreover, the
diffusivity for short-time measurements is intrinsically different from
that for long-time measurements. This fluctuating diffusivity results from
dynamic changes in interactions between the PH domain and PIP molecules.
Our results provide evidence that the complexity of protein-lipid
interactions plays a crucial role in the diffusion of proteins on
biological membrane surfaces. Changes in the diffusivity of PH domains and
related membrane-bound proteins may in turn contribute to the

	abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)) is an important
lipidic signaling molecule that is involved in a broad range of cellular
processes. Its interaction with proteins and its lateral distribution are
governed by the ionization state of the phosphomonoester groups and its
ability to form intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In this study we
have investigated the ionization state of PI(4,5)P(2) in ternary lipid
vesicle systems that contain in addition to PI(4,5)P(2) and
phosphatidylcholine (PC) either phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),
phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylinositol (PI). In the presence of
PE we find an increased ionization of PI(4,5)P(2), which can be attributed
to increased deprotonation due to hydrogen bond formation between PE and
the PI(4,5)P(2) phosphomonoester groups. However, the effect of PE on
PI(4,5)P(2) ionization is significantly smaller than it had been found
previously for phosphatidic acid in the presence of PE (Kooijman et al.,
2005). The reduced impact of PE on PI(4,5)P(2) ionization can be
attributed to competing intramolecular hydrogen bond formation between the
phosphomonoester groups and neighboring hydroxyl groups. It is noteworthy
that the presence of PE affects more strongly the ionization of the
5-phosphate group than that of the 4-phosphate, suggesting that the
interaction of PE with the 5-phosphate is stronger. In PI(4,5)P(2)/PS/PC
lipid vesicles, the presence of PS was expected to yield an increased
protonation of the PI(4,5)P(2) phosphomonoester groups due to a decreased
interfacial pH as a result of the increased negative interfacial charge.
However, the effect of PS on PI(4,5)P(2) ionization is only minor,
potentially suggesting that PS and PI(4,5)P(2) are demixed. The
PI(4,5)P(2)/PI/PC vesicle system was characterized by a surprising mixing
behavior that has potentially far reaching consequences: fluorescence
microscopy measurements of giant unilammellar vesicles composed of
PI(4,5)P(2)/PI/PC at physiological concentrations show that PI and
PI(4,5)P(2) form macroscopic, fluid phase domains in contact with a fluid
PC rich phase (fluid/fluid demixing). Despite the fact that PI and
PI(4,5)P(2) co-localize, the effect of PI on PI(4,5)P(2) ionization
behavior is only noticeable above pH 7. Apparently two opposing effects
lead to the observed behavior: Due to the presence of the anionic PI, the
interfacial pH drops, which is expected to lead to an enhanced protonation
of the PI(4,5)P(2) phosphomonoester groups. In turn, hydrogen bond
formation between PI and PI(4,5)P(2) would lead to the opposite, i.e.
increased deprotonation of the phosphomonoester group. Apparently these
two effects compensate each other for pH values smaller than about 7,
while for higher pH values the increased interfacial pH in the presence of
PI has a stronger impact than PI/PI(4,5)P(2) hydrogen bond formation. The
cooperative formation of PI/PI(4,5)P(2) mixed domains has potentially
important ramifications for the spatial organization of phosphoinositide
mediated signaling events.},

receptor signaling complexes to the cytoskeletal actin network, which
organizes the spatial and temporal localization of signaling events. Here
we report that the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 (CD44ct) is largely
disordered. Upon binding to the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), CD44ct clusters into aggregates. Further,
contrary to the generally accepted model, CD44ct does not bind directly to
the FERM domain of Ezrin or to the full-length Ezrin but only forms a
complex with FERM or with the full-length Ezrin in the presence of PIP2.
Using contrast variation small angle neutron scattering, we show that PIP2
mediates the assembly of a specific heterotetramer complex of CD44ct with
Ezrin. This study reveals the role of PIP2 in clustering CD44 and in
assembling multimeric CD44-Ezrin complexes. We hypothesize that polyvalent

to simulate receptor-mediated adhesion of deformable platelets at the site

membrane submodel to represent physiological elastic properties of a
platelet, stochastic receptor-ligand binding submodel to describe cell
adhesion kinetics and lattice Boltzmann submodel for simulating blood

simulation performance. Predictive model simulations revealed that
platelet deformation, interactions between platelets in the vicinity of
the vessel wall as well as the number of functional GPIbα platelet
receptors played significant roles in platelet adhesion to the injury

cells, and the ubiquity of protein localization in prokaryotic species is
now acquiring greater appreciation. Though some targeting anchors are
known, the origin of polar and division-site localization remains
mysterious for a large fraction of bacterial proteins. Ultimately, the
molecular components responsible for such symmetry breaking must employ a
high degree of self-organization. Here we propose a novel physical
mechanism, based on the two-dimensional curvature of the membrane, for
spontaneous lipid targeting to the poles and division site of rod-shaped
bacterial cells. If one of the membrane components has a large intrinsic
curvature, the geometrical constraint of the plasma membrane by the more
rigid bacterial cell wall naturally leads to lipid microphase separation.
We find that the resulting clusters of high-curvature lipids are large
enough to spontaneously and stably localize to the two cell poles. Recent
evidence of localization of the phospholipid cardiolipin to the poles of
bacterial cells suggests that polar targeting of some proteins may rely on
the membrane's differential lipid content. More generally, aggregates of
lipids, proteins, or lipid-protein complexes may localize in response to
features of cell geometry incapable of localizing individual molecules.},

mitochondria; its quantity is equimolecular to the Adenylic Nucleotide
Translocator and represents 1\% of the mitochondrial proteins. It is a
multitask protein localized in the mitochondria intermembrane space where
it binds to the specific cardiolipin (CL) phospholipid. If mtCK was
initially thought to be exclusively implicated in energy transfer between
mitochondria and cytosol through a mechanism referred to as the
phosphocreatine shuttle, several recent studies suggested an additional
role in maintaining mitochondria membrane structure. METHODS: To further
characterized mtCK binding process we used multiphoton excitation
fluorescence microscopy coupled with Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUV) and
laurdan as fluorescence probe. RESULTS: We gathered structural and
dynamical information on the molecular events occurring during the binding
of mtCK to the mitochondria inner membrane. We present the first
visualization of mtCK-induced CL segregation on a bilayer model forming
micrometer-size proteolipid domains at the surface of the GUV. Those
microdomains, which only occurred when CL is included in the lipid
mixture, were accompanied by the formation of protein multimolecular
assembly, vesicle clamping, and changes in both vesicle curvature and
membrane fluidity CONCLUSION: Those results highlighted the importance of
the highly abundant mtCK in the lateral organization of the mitochondrial
inner membrane. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Microdomains were induced in

protein targeting and transmembrane signaling. Its occurrence in both
membrane leaflets commonly gives rise to matching liquid or liquid-ordered
domains in the opposing monolayers. The underlying mechanism of such

around the thicker ordered domain constitutes an important driving force.
Yet, robust domain coupling requires an additional energy source, which we
have now identified as thermal undulations. Our theoretical analysis of
elastic deformations in a lipid bilayer shows that stiffer lipid domains
tend to distribute into areas with lower fluctuations of monolayer
curvature. These areas naturally align in the opposing monolayers. Thus,
coupling requires both membrane leafs to display a heterogeneity in splay
rigidities. The heterogeneity may either originate from intrinsic lipid
properties or be acquired by adsorption of peripheral molecules.
Undulations and line tension act synergistically: the gain in energy due a
minimized line tension is proportional to domain radius and thus primarily
fuels the registration of smaller domains; whereas the energetic
contribution of undulations increases with membrane area and thus
primarily acts to coalesce larger domains.},

us to predict the consequences of recursive properties in such interaction

proteins thought to regulate endosomal sorting of internalized receptors.
The prototypical SNX is sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), a protein that through its
PX domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and
phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P(2)]. SNX1 is
associated with early endosomes, from where it has been proposed to
regulate the degradation of internalized epidermal growth factor (EGF)
receptors through modulating endosomal-to-lysosomal sorting. RESULTS: We
show here that SNX1 contains a BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, a
membrane binding domain that endows SNX1 with the ability to form dimers
and to sense membrane curvature. We present evidence that through
coincidence detection, the BAR and PX domains efficiently target SNX1 to a
microdomain of the early endosome defined by high curvature and the
presence of 3-phosphoinositides. In addition, we show that the BAR domain
endows SNX1 with an ability to tubulate membranes in-vitro and drive the
tubulation of the endosomal compartment in-vivo. Using RNA interference
(RNAi), we establish that SNX1 does not play a role in EGF or transferrin
receptor sorting; rather it specifically perturbs endosome-to-trans Golgi
network (TGN) transport of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate
receptor (CI-MPR). Our data support an evolutionarily conserved function
for SNX1 from yeast to mammals and provide functional insight into the
molecular mechanisms underlying lipid-mediated protein targeting and
tubular-based protein sorting. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that through
coincidence detection SNX1 associates with a microdomain of the early
endosome-characterized by high membrane curvature and the presence of
3-phosphoinositides-from where it regulates tubular-based endosome-to-TGN
retrieval of the CI-MPR.},

(MPs) are important to understand because they underlie virtually all
physiological processes in cells including key metabolic pathways, such as
the respiratory chain and the photosystems, as well as the transport of
solutes and signals across membranes. Nearly all MPs require
translocons--often referred to as protein-conducting channels--for proper
insertion into their target membrane. Remarkable progress toward
understanding the structure and functioning of translocons has been made
during the past decade. Here, we review and assess this progress
critically. All available evidence indicates that MPs are equilibrium
structures that achieve their final structural states by folding along
thermodynamically controlled pathways. The main challenge for cells is the
targeting and membrane insertion of highly hydrophobic amino acid
sequences. Targeting and insertion are managed in cells principally by
interactions between ribosomes and membrane-embedded translocons. Our
review examines the biophysical and biological boundaries of MP insertion
and the folding of polytopic MPs in vivo. A theme of the review is the
under-appreciated role of basic thermodynamic principles in MP folding and
assembly. Thermodynamics not only dictates the final folded structure but
also is the driving force for the evolution of the ribosome-translocon
system of assembly. We conclude the review with a perspective suggesting a
new view of translocon-guided MP insertion.},

membrane trafficking pathways. Ca2+ signal transduction commonly occurs
through interaction with protein partners. However, in this study we show
a novel mechanism by which Ca2+ may impact membrane structure. We find an
asymmetric concentration of Ca2+ across the membrane triggers deformation
of membranes containing negatively charged lipids such as
phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
(PI(4,5)P2). Membrane invaginations in vesicles were observed forming away
from the leaflet with higher Ca2+ concentration, showing that Ca2+ induces
negative curvature. We hypothesize that the negative curvature is produced
by Ca2+-induced clustering of PS and PI(4,5)P2. In support of this notion,
we find that Ca2+-induced membrane deformation is stronger for membranes
containing PI(4,5)P2, which is known to more readily cluster in the
presence of Ca2+. The observed Ca2+-induced membrane deformation is
strongly influenced by Na+ ions. A high symmetric [Na+] across the
membrane reduces Ca2+ binding by electrostatic shielding, inhibiting
Ca2+-induced membrane deformation. An asymmetric [Na+] across the
membrane, however, can either oppose or support Ca2+-induced deformation,
depending on the direction of the gradient in [Na+]. At a sufficiently
high asymmetric Na+ concentration it can impact membrane structure in the
absence of Ca2+. We propose that Ca2+ works in concert with curvature
generating proteins to modulate membrane curvature and shape transitions.
This novel structural impact of Ca2+ could be important for Ca2+-dependent
cellular processes that involve the creation of membrane curvature,
including exocytosis, invadopodia, and cell motility.},

to detect domains with such properties. Here, the sensitivity of the

of1-palmitoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]-hexanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phospholipid
(C6-NBD-phospholipid) analogues has been employed to characterize lipid
domains in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and the plasma membrane of
mammalian cells by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Fluorescence
decay of C6-NBD-phosphatidylcholine is characterized by a short and long
lifetime. For GUVs forming microscopically visible lipid domains the
longer lifetime in the liquid disordered (ld) and the liquid ordered (lo)
phase was clearly distinct, being approximately 7 ns and 11 ns,
respectively. Lifetimes were not sensitive to variation of cholesterol
concentration of domain-forming GUVs indicating that the lipid composition
and physical properties of those lipid domains are well defined entities.
Even the existence of submicroscopic domains can be detected by FLIM as
demonstrated for GUVs of palmitoyloleoyl
phosphatidylcholine/N-palmitoyl-d-sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixtures. A
broad distribution of the long lifetime was found for
C6-NBD-phosphatidylcholine inserted in the plasma membrane of HepG2 and
HeLa cells centered around 11 ns. FLIM studies on lipid domains forming
giant vesicles derived from the plasma membrane of HeLa cells may suggest
that a variety of submicroscopic lipid domains exists in the plasma

scaffolding mechanism, rather than H0 insertion, for the membrane

with important signaling functions in the regulation of cell-substrate

enriched regions. To elucidate the molecular basis of activation, we
performed a systematic screening of binding orientations of FAK's
autoinhibited FERM-kinase complex, as well as of the dissociated FERM and
kinase domains alone, on model plasma membranes using coarse-grained scFix
MARTINI simulations, partially corroborated by atomistic MD simulations.
The proteins adopted many more different orientations than previously
thought. The presence of PIP2 tuned and narrowed the complex map of
competing interfacial orientations. The dissociated FERM domain most
frequently interacted with the membrane through its autoinhibitory
interface rather than with the "basic patch" residues. These findings
suggest a PIP2-dependent activation mechanism in which membrane binding of
the dissociated FERM domain competes with the rebinding of the kinase
domain. This competition could promote FAK autophosphorylation on Y397 and
subsequent Src binding. The orientation of peripheral proteins at
membranes is crucial to understand cell adhesion processes and is
furthermore required to exploit steered molecular dynamics to predict how
tensile forces might switch their active states.},

their effects cancel each other for the first short period but later the

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The polyvalent acidic lipid phosphatidylinositol,
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is important for many cellular functions. It has
been suggested that different pools of PIP2 exist in the cytoplasmic
leaflet of the plasma membrane, and that such pooling could play a role in
the regulation of PIP2. The mechanism of fencing, however, is not
understood. RESULTS: This study presents the results of Langevin dynamics
simulations of PIP2 to elucidate some of the molecular level
considerations that must be applied to models for fencing. For each
simulation, a pool of PIP2 (modeled as charged spheres) was placed in
containments with boundaries modeled as a single row of rods (steric or
electrostatic) or rigid protein filaments. It is shown that even a small
gap (20 Å, which is 1.85 times larger than the diameter of a PIP2 sphere)
leads to poor steric blocking, and that electrostatic blockage is only
effective at very high charge density. Filaments of human septin, yeast
septin, and actin also failed to provide adequate blockage when placed on
the membrane surface. The two septins do provide high blockage consistent
with experiment and with phenomenological considerations of permeability
when they are buried 9 Å and 12 Å below the membrane surface,
respectively. In contrast, burial does not improve blockage by the
"arch-shaped" actin filaments. Free energy estimates using implicit
membrane-solvent models indicate that burial of the septins to about 10 Å
can be achieved without penetration of charged residues into the
hydrophobic region of the membrane. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that
a functioning fence assembled from protein filaments must either be buried
well below the membrane surface, have more than a single row, or contain
additional components that fill small gaps in the filaments.},

structural role of the HVR regarding protein-early endosome membrane
recruitment is not resolved due to its high degree of flexibility and lack
of crystallographic information. Here, full-atomistic and coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations of the truncated Rab5 HVR206-215 in three
model membranes of increasing complexity (pure phospholipid bilayer,
ternary membrane with cholesterol, six-component early endosome) were
performed. Specific electrostatic interactions between the HVR206-215
Arg209 residue and the phosphate group of the inositol ring of PI(3)P were
detected. This shows that PI(3)P acts as a first contact site of protein
recruitment to the early endosome. The free energy change of HVR206-215
extraction from the bilayer was largest for the physiological negatively
charged membrane. 5μs coarse-grained simulations revealed an active
recruitment of PI(3)P to the HVR206-215 supporting the formation of Rab5-
and PI(3)P enriched signaling platforms.},

Auxilin has a region resembling PTEN, a PI3P phosphatase. We have
determined the crystal structure of this region of bovine auxilin 1; it
indeed resembles PTEN closely. A change in the structure of the P loop
accounts for the lack of phosphatase activity. Inclusion of
phosphatidylinositol phosphates substantially enhances liposome binding by
wild-type auxilin, but not by various mutants bearing changes in loops of
the C2 domain. Nearly all these mutations also prevent recruitment of
auxilin to newly budded coated vesicles. We propose a specific geometry
for auxilin association with a membrane bilayer and discuss implications
of this model for the mechanism by which auxilin detects separation of a

membrane fusion, from stalk formation, to pore creation, and through
fusion pore enlargement. The model assumes that each structure in the
pathway is axially symmetric. The static continuum stalk structure agrees
quantitatively with experimental stalk architecture. Calculations show
that in a stalk, the distal monolayer is stretched and the stored
stretching energy is significantly less than the tilt energy of an
unstretched distal monolayer. The string method is used to determine the
energy of the transition barriers that separate intermediate states and
the dynamics of two bilayers as they pass through them. Hemifusion
requires a small amount of energy independently of lipid composition,
while direct transition from a stalk to a fusion pore without a hemifusion
intermediate is highly improbable. Hemifusion diaphragm expansion is
spontaneous for distal monolayers containing at least two lipid
components, given sufficiently negative diaphragm spontaneous curvature.
Conversely, diaphragms formed from single-component distal monolayers do
not expand without the continual injection of energy. We identify a
diaphragm radius, below which central pore expansion is spontaneous. For
larger diaphragms, prior studies have shown that pore expansion is not
axisymmetric, and here our calculations supply an upper bound for the
energy of the barrier against pore formation. The major energy-requiring
deformations in the steps of fusion are: widening of a hydrophobic fissure
in bilayers for stalk formation, splay within the expanding hemifusion
diaphragm, and fissure widening initiating pore formation in a hemifusion
diaphragm.},

Cleavage of APP by β-secretase produces a 99 amino acid C-terminal

Simulations of C99 congeners and structural studies of C99 in surfactant
micelles and lipid vesicles have shown that a key peptide structural motif
is a prominent "GG kink," centered at two glycines dividing the TM helix.
The flexibility of the GG kink is important in the processing of C99 by
γ-secretase. We performed multiscale simulations of C99(15-55) in a DPC
surfactant micelle and POPC lipid bilayer in order to elucidate the role
of membrane surface curvature in modulating the peptide structure.
C99(15-55) in a DPC surfactant micelle possesses a "GG kink," in the TM
domain near the dynamic hinge located at G37/G38. Such a kink is not
observed in C99(15-55) in a POPC lipid bilayer. Intramolecular interaction
between the extracellular and TM domains of C99(15-55) is enhanced in the

concentration of cholesterol in the bilayer exceeds a critical value,
phase separation occurs. The coexistence between cholesterol-rich and
cholesterol-poor domains is universal for any bilayer parameters, although
the composition of the cholesterol-rich phase varies as a function of the
lipid properties. Although we do not assume specific cholesterol-lipid

the difficulty of abstracting and simplifying biological complexity but

rare low-density fluctuations in particular, serve as reliable indicators
of surface hydrophobicity; the easier it is to displace the interfacial
waters, the more hydrophobic the underlying surface is. However,
characterizing the free energetics of such rare fluctuations requires
computationally expensive, non-Boltzmann sampling methods like umbrella
sampling. This inherent computational expense associated with umbrella
sampling makes it challenging to investigate the role of polarizability or
electronic structure effects in influencing interfacial fluctuations.
Importantly, it also limits the size of the volume, which can be used to
probe interfacial fluctuations. The latter can be particularly important
in characterizing the hydrophobicity of large surfaces with
molecular-level heterogeneities, such as those presented by proteins. To
overcome these challenges, here we present a method for the sparse
sampling of water density fluctuations, which is roughly 2 orders of
magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling. We employ thermodynamic
integration to estimate the free energy differences between biased
ensembles, thereby circumventing the umbrella sampling requirement of
overlap between adjacent biased distributions. Further, a judicious choice
of the biasing potential allows such free energy differences to be
estimated using short simulations, so that the free energetics of water
density fluctuations are obtained using only a few, short simulations.
Leveraging the efficiency of the method, we characterize water density
fluctuations in the entire hydration shell of the protein, ubiquitin, a
large volume containing an average of more than 600 waters.},

channel inhibition by ATP. Here, we use homology modelling and ligand

consistent with a large amount of functional data and was further tested

	abstract = {To investigate the nanomechanics of the erythrocyte membrane we developed
a hybrid model that couples the actin-spectrin network to the lipid
bilayer. This model features a Fourier space Brownian dynamics model of
the bilayer, a Brownian dynamics model of the actin protofilament, and a
modified wormlike-chain model of the spectrin (including a cable-dynamics
model to predict the oscillation in tension). This model enables us to
predict the nanomechanics of single or multiple units of the protein
network, the lipid bilayer, and the effect of their interactions. The
present work is focused on the attitude of the actin protofilament at the
equilibrium states coupled with the elevations of the lipid bilayer
through their primary linkage at the suspension complex in deformations.
Two different actin-spectrin junctions are considered at the junctional
complex. With a point-attachment junction, large pitch angles and
bifurcation of yaw angles are predicted. Thermal fluctuations at
bifurcation may lead to mode-switching, which may affect the network and
the physiological performance of the membrane. In contrast, with a
wrap-around junction, pitch angles remain small, and the occurrence of
bifurcation is greatly reduced. These simulations suggest the importance
of three-dimensional molecular junctions and the lipid bilayer/protein
network coupling on cell membrane mechanics.},

membrane model, which contains seven different lipids species including
the glycolipid GM3 in the outer leaflet and the anionic lipid,
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophate (PIP2), in the inner leaflet. Plasma
membrane models consisting of 1500 lipids and resembling the in vivo
composition were constructed and simulations were run for 5 µs. In these
simulations the most striking feature was the formation of nano-clusters
of GM3 within the outer leaflet. In simulations of protein interactions
within a plasma membrane model, GM3, PIP2, and cholesterol all formed
favorable interactions with the model α-helical protein. A larger scale
simulation of a model plasma membrane containing 6000 lipid molecules
revealed correlations between curvature of the bilayer surface and
clustering of lipid molecules. In particular, the concave (when viewed
from the extracellular side) regions of the bilayer surface were locally
enriched in GM3. In summary, these simulations explore the nanoscale
dynamics of model bilayers which mimic the in vivo lipid composition of
mammalian plasma membranes, revealing emergent nanoscale membrane
organization which may be coupled both to fluctuations in local membrane

consequences of bilayer intrinsic curvature. Structural changes in the
Escherichia coli large MS channel (MscL) were studied under nominally zero
transbilayer pressures using both patch clamp and EPR spectroscopic
approaches. Changes in membrane intrinsic curvature induced by the
external addition of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) generated massive
spectroscopic changes in the narrow constriction that forms the channel
'gate', trapping the channel in the fully open state. Hydrophobic mismatch
alone was unable to open the channel, but decreasing bilayer thickness
lowered MscL activation energy, stabilizing a structurally distinct closed
channel intermediate. We propose that the mechanism of mechanotransduction
in MS channels is defined by both local and global asymmetries in the

	abstract = {The majority of biosynthetic secretory proteins initiate their journey
through the endomembrane system from specific subdomains of the
endoplasmic reticulum. At these locations, coated transport carriers are
generated, with the Sar1 GTPase playing a critical role in membrane
bending, recruitment of coat components, and nascent vesicle formation.
How these events are appropriately coordinated remains poorly understood.
Here, we demonstrate that Sar1 acts as the curvature-sensing component of
the COPII coat complex and highlight the ability of Sar1 to bind more
avidly to membranes of high curvature. Additionally, using an atomic force
microscopy-based approach, we further show that the intrinsic GTPase
activity of Sar1 is necessary for remodeling lipid bilayers. Consistent
with this idea, Sar1-mediated membrane remodeling is dramatically
accelerated in the presence of its guanine nucleotide-activating protein
(GAP), Sec23-Sec24, and blocked upon addition of
guanosine-5'-[(β,γ)-imido]triphosphate, a poorly hydrolysable analog of
GTP. Our results also indicate that Sar1 GTPase activity is stimulated by
membranes that exhibit elevated curvature, potentially enabling Sar1
membrane scission activity to be spatially restricted to highly bent
membranes that are characteristic of a bud neck. Taken together, our data
support a stepwise model in which the amino-terminal amphipathic helix of
GTP-bound Sar1 stably penetrates the endoplasmic reticulum membrane,
promoting local membrane deformation. As membrane bending increases, Sar1
membrane binding is elevated, ultimately culminating in GTP hydrolysis,
which may destabilize the bilayer sufficiently to facilitate membrane
fission.},

facilitate its correct orientation relative to the membrane. Mutations in
three basic residues (R301E/R307E/K311E) of the C2 subdomain of the

migrating cells, FBP17 localizes to short membrane invaginations at the

tension increase. Conversely, following reduced PM tension, FBP17 dots
randomly distribute throughout the cell, correlating with loss of
polarized actin assembly on PM tension reduction. Actin protrusive force
is required for the polarized accumulation, indicating a role for
FBP17-mediated activation of WASP/N-WASP in PM tension generation. In

There is excellent agreement between MD simulations and experimental

discrepancy between simulation and experiment is a measure of (DB-DHH)/2
where DHH is the distance between the maxima in the electron density

of contact frequencies for atom pairs demonstrates that the number of salt
bridge contacts between the two molecules is unaffected by temperature,
whereas the numbers of hydrophobic and polar contacts are greatly
diminished. A second, independent set of simulations-using rigid,

Many of these proteins are activated by increases in intracellular
calcium. Recent results also suggest that receptor-mediated changes in

gelsolin and profilin, specifically interact with phosphatidylinositol

	abstract = {Local accumulation of phosphoinositides (PIPs) is an important factor for
a broad range of cellular events including membrane trafficking and cell
signaling. The negatively charged phosphoinositide headgroups can interact
with cations or cationic proteins and this electrostatic interaction has
been identified as the main phosphoinositide clustering mechanism.
However, an increasing number of reports show that
phosphoinositide-mediated signaling events are at least in some cases
cholesterol dependent, suggesting other possible contributors to the
segregation of phosphoinositides. Using fluorescence microscopy on giant
unilamellar vesicles and monolayers at the air/water interface, we present
data showing that cholesterol stabilizes fluid phosphoinositide-enriched
phases. The interaction with cholesterol is observed for all investigated
phosphoinositides (PI(4)P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, PI(4,5)P2 and
PI(3,4,5)P3) as well as phosphatidylinositol. We find that cholesterol is
present in the phosphoinositide-enriched phase and that the resulting
phase is fluid. Cholesterol derivatives modified at the hydroxyl group
(cholestenone, cholesteryl ethyl ether) do not promote formation of
phosphoinositide domains, suggesting an instrumental role of the
cholesterol hydroxyl group in the observed cholesterol/phosphoinositide
interaction. This leads to the hypothesis that cholesterol participates in
an intermolecular hydrogen bond network formed among the phosphoinositide
lipids. We had previously reported that the intra- and intermolecular
hydrogen bond network between the phosphoinositide lipids leads to a
reduction of the charge density at the phosphoinositide phosphomonoester
groups (Kooijman et al., 2009). We believe that cholesterol acts as a
spacer between the phosphoinositide lipids, thereby reducing the
electrostatic repulsion, while participating in the hydrogen bond network,
leading to its further stabilization. To illustrate the effect of
phosphoinositide segregation on protein binding, we show that binding of
the tumor suppressor protein PTEN to PI(5)P and PI(4,5)P2 is enhanced in
the presence of cholesterol. These results provide new insights into how
phosphoinositides mediate important cellular events.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Membrane proteins are underrepresented in structural
databases, which has led to a lack of computational tools and the
corresponding inappropriate use of tools designed for soluble proteins.
For membrane proteins, lipid accessibility is an essential property.
Although programs are available for sequence-based prediction of lipid
accessibility and structure-based identification of solvent-accessible
surface area, the latter does not distinguish between water accessible and
lipid accessible residues in membrane proteins. RESULTS: Here we present
mp\_lipid\_acc, the first method to identify lipid accessible residues from
the protein structure, implemented in the RosettaMP framework and
available as a webserver. Our method uses protein structures transformed
in membrane coordinates, for instance from PDBTM or OPM databases, and a
defined membrane thickness to classify lipid accessibility of residues.
mp\_lipid\_acc is applicable to both α-helical and β-barrel membrane
proteins of diverse architectures with or without water-filled pores and
uses a concave hull algorithm for surface-residue classification. We
further provide a manually curated benchmark dataset that can be used for
further method development. CONCLUSIONS: We present a novel tool to
classify lipid accessibility from the protein structure, which is
applicable to proteins of diverse architectures and achieves prediction
accuracies of 90\% on a manually curated database. mp\_lipid\_acc is part of
the Rosetta software suite, available at www.rosettacommons.org . The

interactions at the lipid-protein interface, global interactions such as
the distribution of internal lateral pressure may also influence protein

pressure profile on the conformation or insertion of proteins in membranes
are equivalent to the elastic response to the frustrated spontaneous
curvature, c(o), of the component lipid monolayer leaflets. The chemical
potential of the protein in the membrane is predicted to depend linearly
on the spontaneous curvature of the lipid leaflets, just as does the
contribution of the protein to the elastic bending energy of the lipid,
and to be independent of the hydrophobic tension, gamma(phob), at the
lipid-water interface. Analysis of the dependence of protein partitioning
or conformational transitions on spontaneous curvature of the constituent
lipids gives an experimental estimate for the cross-sectional
intramembrane shape of the protein or its difference between
conformations. Values in the region of 50-110 A(2) are estimated for the
effective cross-sectional shape changes on the insertion and conductance
transitions of alamethicin, and on the activation of CTP:phosphocholine
cytidylyltransferase or rhodopsin in lipid membranes. Much larger values
are estimated for the mechanosensitive channel, MscL. Values for the
change in intramembrane shape may also be used, together with
determinations of lipid relative association constants, to estimate
contributions of direct lipid-protein interactions to the lateral pressure

hydrophilic within the hydrogel structure. Effects of cross-linking on the

with the all-atom method, demonstrating the capability of the model to
capture the correct dynamic evolution of the system. The all-atom model of
the hydrogel was mapped to the CG model using the MARTINI force field.
This method resulted in a more realistic representation of the stiffness

used to measure the binding and dissociation of a recombinant myo1c

second-order rate constant was approximately diffusion-limited. Increasing
the molar ratio of anionic phospholipid by adding phosphatidylserine,
additional PtdIns(4,5)P(2), or by situating PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in a more

stretching and compression, on the other hand, are determined by the

combined bending and stretching energy with respect to membrane area for
fixed vesicle volume. As a consequence, the mechanical tension within a

	abstract = {Interactions between proteins are orchestrated in a precise and
time-dependent manner, underlying cellular function. The binding affinity,
defined as the strength of these interactions, is translated into
physico-chemical terms in the dissociation constant (K(d)), the latter
being an experimental measure that determines whether an interaction will
be formed in solution or not. Predicting binding affinity from structural
models has been a matter of active research for more than 40 years because
of its fundamental role in drug development. However, all available
approaches are incapable of predicting the binding affinity of
protein-protein complexes from coordinates alone. Here, we examine both
theoretical and experimental limitations that complicate the derivation of
structure-affinity relationships. Most work so far has concentrated on
binary interactions. Systems of increased complexity are far from being
understood. The main physico-chemical measure that relates to binding
affinity is the buried surface area, but it does not hold for flexible
complexes. For the latter, there must be a significant entropic
contribution that will have to be approximated in the future. We foresee
that any theoretical modelling of these interactions will have to follow
an integrative approach considering the biology, chemistry and physics
that underlie protein-protein recognition.},

site comprises two distinct regions. One of these regions is exposed in
the full-length autoinhibited conformation of vinculin, whereas the second

accessibility of the F-actin binding site in the autoinhibited full-length
vinculin structure suggests that F-actin can act as part of a
combinatorial input framework with other binding partners such as
alpha-catenin or talin to induce vinculin head-tail dissociation, thus
promoting vinculin activation. Furthermore, binding to F-actin potentiates
a local rearrangement in the vinculin tail that in turn promotes vinculin
dimerization and, hence, formation of actin bundles.},

plugin integrated within the widely used molecular visualization and

comprehensive set of biological molecules in vacuo. The resulting
comparison between energy terms shows that the translation performed was
lossless as the energies were unchanged for identical starting
configurations. By applying the conversion process to conventional
benchmark systems that mimic typical modestly sized MD systems, we explore
the effect of the implementation choices made in CHARMM, NAMD, and
GROMACS. The newly available automatic conversion capability breaks down
barriers between simulation tools and user communities and allows users to

relevant protein-lipid interactions can be included in the continuum
representation of the protein-bilayer interactions through the physical
parameters determined for protein-free bilayers and the choice of boundary
conditions at the protein/bilayer interface. To better understand this
assumption, we review the general structure of CEMs, examine how different
choices of boundary conditions and physical moduli profiles alter the
predicted bilayer thickness profiles around gramicidin A (gA) and
mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), respectively, and
compare these profiles with those obtained from all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations. We find that the profiles differ qualitatively in
the first lipid shell around the channels, indicating that the CEMs do not
capture accurately the consequences of the protein-induced local changes
in lipid bilayer dynamics. Therefore, one needs to be careful when
interpreting the results of CEM-based analyses of lipid bilayer-membrane

permeabilization in bilayers containing either SM or dihydro-SM (lacking
the trans Δ(4) double bond of the long-chain base), since their
hydrogen-bonding properties are known to differ greatly. We observed that
whereas both StnI and StnII formed pores in unilamellar vesicles
containing palmitoyl-SM or oleoyl-SM, the toxins failed to similarly form
pores in vesicles prepared from dihydro-PSM or dihydro-OSM. In supported
bilayers containing OSM, StnII bound efficiently, as determined by surface
plasmon resonance. However, StnII binding to supported bilayers prepared
from dihydro-OSM was very low under similar experimental conditions. The
association of the positively charged StnII (at pH7.0) with unilamellar
vesicles prepared from OSM led to a concentration-dependent increase in
vesicle charge, as determined from zeta-potential measurements. With
dihydro-OSM vesicles, a similar response was not observed. Benzyl alcohol,
which is a small hydrogen-bonding compound with affinity to lipid bilayer
interfaces, strongly facilitated StnII-induced pore formation in
dihydro-OSM bilayers, suggesting that hydrogen bonding in the interfacial
region originally prevented StnII from membrane binding and pore
formation. We conclude that interfacial hydrogen bonding was able to
affect the membrane association of StnI- and StnII, and hence their pore
forming capacity. Our results suggest that other types of protein
interactions in bilayers may also be affected by hydrogen-bonding
origination from SMs.},

larger molecular size enhances membrane disruption and pore formation only

electrostatic interactions of linear molecules than are possible for
spheroidal dendrimers, only the dendrimers were found to perforate
membranes, apparently because they cannot spread onto a single leaflet,

interactions with head groups on the opposite leaflet. These results
indicate that a relatively rigid spheroidal shape is more efficient than a
flexible linear shape in increasing membrane permeability. These results

exact mechanism remains undetermined. Various suggestions have been
invoked, including chain interdigitation and rapid translocation of
cholesterol. There is little, if any, direct evidence supporting or
excluding these hypotheses. In this letter, I examine a few different
possibilities. Chain interdigitation is unlikely to be significant.
Cholesterol translocation meets some, though not all, of the relevant
criteria, and probably plays an important role. The simplest explanation
is that the layers interact at the midplane in the same way that the
ordered and disordered liquid phases common in these systems interact at
their interfaces. A quick estimate of that interfacial energy shows that
this is a very likely candidate. The consequences of such an energy in
biological systems are briefly considered.},

at the organelle level, with distinct organelles maintaining their

containing different sets of lipids and proteins. A central question in
the field is thus how this compartmentalization is established and
maintained despite the intense exchange of components and even physical
continuities within the same organelle. The phosphorylated derivatives of
phosphatidylinositol, known as the phosphoinositides, have emerged as key
components in this context, both as regulators of membrane trafficking and
as finely tuned spatial and temporal landmarks for organelle and
sub-organelle domains. The central role of the phosphoinositides in cell
homeostasis is highlighted by the severe consequences of the derangement
of their metabolism caused by genetic deficiencies of the enzymes
involved, and from the systematic hijacking of phosphoinositide metabolism
that pathogens operate to promote their entry and/or survival in host

onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that
membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition
of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend
locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface
through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly
of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric

	abstract = {In biological processes, such as fission, fusion and trafficking, it has
been shown that lipids of different shapes are sorted into regions with
different membrane curvatures. This lipid sorting has been hypothesized to
be due to the coupling between the membrane curvature and the lipid's
spontaneous curvature, which is related to the lipid's molecular shape. On
the other hand, theoretical predictions and simulations suggest that the
curvature preference of lipids, due to shape alone, is weaker than that
observed in biological processes. To distinguish between these different
views, we have directly measured the curvature preferences of several
lipids by using a fluorescence-based method. We prepared small unilamellar
vesicles of different sizes with a mixture of egg-PC and a small mole
fraction of N-nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-labeled phospholipids or
lysophospholipids of different chain lengths and saturation, and measured
the NBD equilibrium distribution across the bilayer. We observed that the
transverse lipid distributions depended linearly on membrane curvature,
allowing us to measure the curvature coupling coefficient. Our
measurements are in quantitative agreement with predictions based on
earlier measurements of the spontaneous curvatures of the corresponding
nonfluorescent lipids using X-ray diffraction. We show that, though some
lipids have high spontaneous curvatures, they nevertheless showed weak
curvature preferences because of the low values of the lipid molecular
areas. The weak curvature preference implies that the asymmetric lipid
distributions found in biological membranes are not likely to be driven by
the spontaneous curvature of the lipids, nor are lipids discriminating
sensors of membrane curvature.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate experimentally inaccessible, molecular-level
detail regarding interleaflet interaction in membranes, we have run an
extensive series of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of phase
separated lipid bilayers. The simulations are motivated by differences in
lipid and cholesterol composition in the inner and outer leaflets of
biological membranes. Over the past several years, this phenomenon has
inspired a series of experiments in model membrane systems which have
explored the effects of lipid compositional asymmetry in the two leaflets.
The simulations are directed at understanding one potential consequence of
compositional asymmetry, that being regions of bilayers where
liquid-ordered (L(o)) domains in one leaflet are opposite
liquid-disordered (L(d)) domains in the other leaflet (phase asymmetry).
The simulated bilayers are of two sorts: 1) Compositionally symmetric
leaflets where each of the two leaflets contains an identical, phase
separated (L(o)/L(d)) mixture of cholesterol, saturated and unsaturated
phospholipid; and 2) Compositionally asymmetric leaflets, where one
leaflet contains a phase separated (L(o)/L(d)) mixture while the other
contains only unsaturated lipid, which on its own would be in the L(d)
phase. In addition, we have run simulations where the lengths of the
saturated lipid chains as well as the mole ratios of the three lipid
components are varied. Collectively, we report on three types of
interleaflet coupling within a bilayer. First, we show the effects of
compositional asymmetry on acyl chain tilt and order, lipid rotational
dynamics, and lateral diffusion in regions of leaflets that are opposite
L(o) domains. Second, we show substantial effects of compositional
asymmetry on local bilayer curvature, with the conclusion that phase
separated leaflets resist curvature, while inducing large degrees of
curvature in an opposing L(d) leaflet. Finally, in compositionally
symmetric, phase separated bilayers, we find phase asymmetry (domain
antiregistration) between the two leaflets occurs as a consequence of
mismatched acyl chain-lengths in the saturated and unsaturated lipids.},

exocytosed SV proteins, and then examined the effect of experimental
treatments on the distribution of these proteins within the presynaptic
plasma membrane by confocal microscopy. SV proteins synaptotagmin, vglut
and csp were clustered following SV trapping in control experiments but
dispersed in samples treated with the cholesterol chelator
methyl-β-cyclodextrin to extract SV cholesterol. There was accumulation of
phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) in presynaptic terminals
following SV trapping and this was reduced following SV cholesterol
extraction. Reduced PIP2 accumulation was associated with disrupted
accumulation of actin in presynaptic terminals. Similar to vesicular
cholesterol extraction, disruption of actin by latrunculin A after SV
proteins had been trapped on the plasma membrane resulted in the dispersal
of SV proteins and prevented recovery of synaptic transmission due to
impaired endocytosis following relief of the endocytic block. Our results
demonstrate that vesicular cholesterol is required for aggregation of
exocytosed SV proteins in the presynaptic plasma membrane and are
consistent with a mechanism involving regulation of PIP2 accumulation and
local actin polymerization by cholesterol. Thus, alteration of membrane or
SV lipids may affect the ability of synapses to undergo sustained synaptic
transmission by compromising the recycling of SV proteins.},

protein involved in rearrangements of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane

most likely of three membrane domains. The N- and C-terminal domains are
supposed to traverse the lipid membrane whereas the central one is thought
to reside on the membrane surface, thus forming a u-shaped protein. All
three membrane domains are proposed to be helical by secondary structure
prediction programs. After performing multi nanosecond molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations at various temperatures (300, 310, and 315.15 K) with
each of the individual domains, they are used in a docking approach to
define putative association motifs of the transmembrane domains (TMDs).
Two structures of the u-shaped protein are generated by separating two
assembled TMDs linking them with the membrane-attached domain. Lipid
undulation is monitored with the structures embedded in a fully hydrated
lipid bilayer applying multiple 200 ns MD simulations at 310 K. An intact
structure of the protein supports membrane undulation. The strong
unwinding of the helices in the domain-linking section of one of the
structures lowers its capability to induce membrane curvature. Unwinding
of the link region is due to interactions of two tryptophan residues,
Trp-96 and 104. These results provide first insights into the

	abstract = {PtdIns(3,5)P(2) is one of the seven regulatory PPIn
(polyphosphoinositides) that are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. It controls
membrane trafficking at multiple points in the endosomal/lysosomal system
and consequently regulates the size, shape and acidity of at least one
endo-lysosomal compartment. PtdIns(3,5)P(2) appears to exert this control
via multiple effector proteins, with each effector specific for a subset
of the various PtdIns(3,5)P(2)-dependent processes. Some putative
PtdIns(3,5)P(2) effectors have been identified, including Atg18p-related
PROPPIN [beta-propeller(s) that bind PPIn] proteins and the epsin-like
proteins Ent3p and Ent5p, whereas others remain to be defined. One of the
principal functions of PtdIns(3,5)P(2) is to regulate the
fission/fragmentation of endo-lysosomal sub-compartments. PtdIns(3,5)P(2)
is required for vesicle formation during protein trafficking between
endo-lysosomes and also for fragmentation of endo-lysosomes into smaller
compartments. In yeast, hyperosmotic stress accelerates the latter
process. In the present review we highlight and discuss recent studies
that reveal the role of the HOPS-CORVET complex and the vacuolar
H(+)-ATPase in the process of endo-lysosome fission, and speculate on
connections between these machineries and the Fab1p pathway. We also
discuss new evidence linking PtdIns(3,5)P(2) and PtdIns5P to the
regulation of exocytosis.},

	abstract = {We investigate the phase separation of Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles in the
presence of cosolute crowders using molecular dynamics simulations. In the
absence of crowders, LJ particles phase-separate and form liquid and vapor
phases only when the attraction between LJ particles is strong enough such
that k(B)T/ε is less than 1.085, where ε is the attraction strength of the
LJ potential, k(B) is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. On
the other hand, the phase separation of LJ particles is observed even for
larger k(B)T/ε and thus for weaker attractions when volume exclusive,
repulsive crowders are present. Although the impact of crowding becomes
less significant as the attraction between crowders and LJ particles is
increased, the phase separation observed from simulations containing both
nonattractive and attractive crowders shows that the crowding-induced
phase separation by nonattractive crowders is still very significant even
in the presence of other attractive crowders. This occurs because not only
LJ particles but also attractive crowders are subject to the excluded
volume effect of nonattractive crowders and found together in the
condensed phase. This study suggests that the excluded volume effect in
the crowded nuclear environment may play a crucial role in the formation
and maintenance of biological structures in a cell, such as nuclear bodies
including nucleoli and cajal bodies.},

hemicelluloses was studied by evaluating the conformational freedom of the
φ and ψ dihedral angles using molecular dynamic simulations, additionally
selected molecules were correlated with experimental data by nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three types of β-(1→4) glycosidic
linkages involving the monosaccharides (Glcp, Xylp and Manp) present in
the backbone of hemicelluloses were defined. Different di- and
tetrasaccharides with combinations of such sugar monomers from
hemicelluloses were simulated, and free energy maps of the φ - ψ space and
hydrogen-bonding patterns were obtained. The glycosidic linkage between
Glc-Glc or Glc-Man (C-type) was the stiffest with mainly one probable
conformation; the linkage from Man-Man or Man-Glc (M-type) was similar but
with an increased probability for an alternative conformation making it
more flexible, and the linkage between two Xyl-units (X-type) was the most
flexible with two almost equally populated conformations. Glycosidic
linkages of the same type showed essentially the same conformational space
in both disaccharides and in the central region of tetrasaccharides.
Different probabilities of glycosidic linkage conformations in the
backbone of hemicelluloses can be directly estimated from the free energy
maps, which to a large degree affect the overall macromolecular
conformations of these polymers. The information gained contributes to an
increased understanding of the function of hemicelluloses both in the cell

molecular dynamics simulations on buckled lipid bilayers to show that the
M2AH senses membrane curvature and preferentially localizes to regions of
high membrane curvature, comparable to that seen at the center neck of
budding influenza viruses. These results were then validated using in
vitro binding assays to show that the M2AH senses membrane curvature by
detecting lipid packing defects in the membrane. Our results show that the
M2AH senses membrane curvature and suggest that the AH domain may localize
the protein at the viral neck where it can then mediate membrane scission

messenger with roles in all eukaryotes and most aspects of human
physiology. By controlling the targeting and activity of its effectors,
PI4,5P₂modulates processes, such as cell migration, vesicular trafficking,
cellular morphogenesis, signaling and gene expression. In cells,
PI4,5P₂has a much higher concentration than other phosphoinositide species
and its total content is largely unchanged in response to extracellular
stimuli. The discovery of a vast array of PI4,5P₂ binding proteins is
consistent with data showing that the majority of cellular PI4,5P₂is
sequestered. This supports a mechanism where PI4,5P₂functions as a
localized and highly specific messenger. Further support of this mechanism
comes from the de novo synthesis of PI4,5P₂which is often linked with PIP
kinase interaction with PI4,5P₂effectors and is a mechanism to define
specificity of PI4,5P₂signaling. The association of PI4,5P₂-generating
enzymes with PI4,5P₂effectors regulate effector function both temporally
and spatially in cells. In this review, the PI4,5P₂effectors whose
functions are tightly regulated by associations with PI4,5P₂-generating

	abstract = {Anionic lipids act as signals for the recruitment of proteins containing
cationic clusters to biological membranes. A family of anionic lipids
known as the phosphoinositides (PIPs) are low in abundance, yet play a
critical role in recruitment of peripheral proteins to the membrane
interface. PIPs are mono-, bis-, or trisphosphorylated derivatives of
phosphatidylinositol (PI) yielding seven species with different structure
and anionic charge. The differential spatial distribution and temporal
appearance of PIPs is key to their role in communicating information to
target proteins. Selective recognition of PIPs came into play with the
discovery that the substrate of protein kinase C termed pleckstrin
possessed the first PIP binding region termed the pleckstrin homology (PH)
domain. Since the discovery of the PH domain, more than ten PIP binding
domains have been identified including PH, ENTH, FYVE, PX, and C2 domains.
Representative examples of each of these domains have been thoroughly
characterized to understand how they coordinate PIP headgroups in
membranes, translocate to specific membrane docking sites in the cell, and
function to regulate the activity of their full-length proteins. In
addition, a number of novel mechanisms of PIP-mediated membrane
association have emerged, such as coincidence detection-specificity for
two distinct lipid headgroups. Other PIP-binding domains may also harbor
selectivity for a membrane physical property such as charge or membrane
curvature. This review summarizes the current understanding of the

compressibility versus system size, down to very small (zero) system size,
where undulations no longer exist. The area compressibility moduli
obtained from such simulations do not agree with experimental true area
compressibility moduli as well as the uncorrected ones from contemporary
or earlier simulations, but tend, instead, to be approximately 50\% too
large. As a byproduct, the bending modulus can be calculated from the

requirement to control ion passage. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume
that lipid composition should modulate ion channel function. There is
increasing evidence that this implicates not just an indirect consequence
of the lipid influence on the physical properties of the membrane, but
also specific binding of selected lipids to certain protein domains. The
result is that channel function and its consequences on excitability,
contractility, intracellular signaling or any other process mediated by
such channel proteins, could be subjected to modulation by membrane
lipids. From this it follows that development, age, diet or diseases that
alter lipid composition should also have an influence on those cellular
properties. The wealth of data on the non-annular lipid binding sites in
potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans (KcsA) makes this protein a
good model to study the modulation of ion channel structure and function
by lipids. The fact that this protein is able to assemble into clusters
through the same non-annular sites, resulting in large changes in channel
activity, makes these sites even more interesting as a potential target to
develop lead compounds able to disrupt such interactions and hopefully, to
modulate ion channel function. This Article is Part of a Special Issue

is observed, and we have used deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy to map the phase boundaries of ternary mixtures containing
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), chain-perdeuterated
1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC-d(62)), and cholesterol.

The deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance spectra for compositions near the
l(d)-l(o) phase boundary at high cholesterol concentrations show evidence
of exchange broadening or critical fluctuations in composition, similar to
that reported by Vist and Davis. There appears to be a line of critical
compositions ranging from 48 degrees C for a DOPC/DPPC-d(62)/cholesterol

proteins, which contain membrane-deforming domains such as the BAR,
EFC/F-BAR, and the IMD/I-BAR domains, led to inward-invaginated tubes or
outward protrusions of the membrane, resulting in a variety of membrane
shapes. Furthermore, these proteins not only bind to phosphoinositide, but
also to the N-WASP/WAVE complex and the actin polymerization machinery,

	abstract = {Mechanosensing at focal adhesions regulates vital cellular processes.
Here, we present results from molecular dynamics (MD) and
mechano-biochemical network simulations that suggest a direct role of
Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) as a mechano-sensor. Tensile forces,
propagating from the membrane through the PIP2 binding site of the FERM
domain and from the cytoskeleton-anchored FAT domain, activate FAK by
unlocking its central phosphorylation site (Tyr576/577) from the
autoinhibitory FERM domain. Varying loading rates, pulling directions, and
membrane PIP2 concentrations corroborate the specific opening of the
FERM-kinase domain interface, due to its remarkably lower mechanical
stability compared to the individual alpha-helical domains and the
PIP2-FERM link. Analyzing downstream signaling networks provides further
evidence for an intrinsic mechano-signaling role of FAK in broadcasting
force signals through Ras to the nucleus. This distinguishes FAK from
hitherto identified focal adhesion mechano-responsive molecules, allowing
a new interpretation of cell stretching experiments.},

tightly regulated by interaction with receptor domains, G protein

recently been shown to modulate its functionality, thus putting forward
new feedback mechanisms connecting different signalling pathways to G

mechanisms governing GRK expression at both transcriptional and protein
stability levels are just beginning to be unveiled. Namely, GRK2 has been
shown to be rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway in a process
dependent on beta-arrestin and c-Src function, and also to be proteolyzed
by m-calpain. A better knowledge of GRK regulatory mechanisms would

novo lipid synthesis and numerous intracellular signaling cascades. The
signaling function of PA is mediated by peripheral membrane proteins that
specifically recognize PA. While numerous PA-binding proteins are known,
much less is known about what drives specificity of PA-protein binding.
Previously, we have described the ionization properties of PA, summarized
in the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch, as one aspect that drives the
specific binding of PA by PA-binding proteins. Here we focus on membrane
curvature stress induced by phosphatidylethanolamine and show that many
PA-binding proteins display enhanced binding as a function of negative
curvature stress. This result is corroborated by the observation that
positive curvature stress, induced by lyso phosphatidylcholine, abolishes
PA binding of target proteins. We show, for the first time, that a novel
plant PA-binding protein, Arabidopsis Epsin-like Clathrin Adaptor 1 (ECA1)
displays curvature-dependence in its binding to PA. Other established PA
targets examined in this study include, the plant proteins TGD2, and PDK1,
the yeast proteins Opi1 and Spo20, and, the mammalian protein Raf-1 kinase
and the C2 domain of the mammalian phosphatidylserine binding protein Lact
as control. Based on our observations, we propose that liposome binding
assays are the preferred method to investigate lipid binding compared to
the popular lipid overlay assays where membrane environment is lost. The
use of complex lipid mixtures is important to elucidate further aspects of
PA binding proteins.},

ubiquitous solvent, but it also actively takes part in many cellular
processes. In particular, the structure and properties of interfacial
water near biomolecules such as proteins are often related to the function
of the respective molecule. It can therefore be highly instructive to
study the local water density around solutes in cellular systems,
particularly when solvent-mediated forces such as the hydrophobic effect
are relevant. Computational methods such as molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations seem well suited to study these systems at the atomic level.
However, due to sampling requirements, it is not clear that MD simulations
are, indeed, the method of choice to obtain converged densities at a given
level of precision. We here compare the calculation of local water
densities with two different methods: MD simulations and the
three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the
Kovalenko-Hirata closure (3D-RISM-KH). In particular, we investigate the
convergence of the local water density to assess the required simulation
times for different levels of resolution. Moreover, we provide a
quantitative comparison of the densities calculated with MD and with
3D-RISM-KH and investigate the effect of the choice of the water model for
both methods. Our results show that 3D-RISM-KH yields density
distributions that are very similar to those from MD up to a 0.5 Å
resolution, but for significantly reduced computational cost. The combined
use of MD and 3D-RISM-KH emerges as an auspicious perspective for
efficient solvent sampling in dynamical systems.},

not very accurate because the atomic/molecular nature of the ions/solvent

studies by ourselves and others that have advanced our understanding are
discussed. These studies show that the GCS theory predicts a narrow double
layer with monotonic profiles. This is not correct. The double layer is
wider, and there can be substantial layering that would be even more
pronounced if explicit solvent molecules are considered. For many years,
experimental studies of the double layer have been directed to the use of
electrochemistry as an analytical tool. This is acceptable for analytic
chemistry studies. However, the understanding of electrochemical reactions
that typically occur at the electrode surface, where simulation and theory
indicate that the GCS theory can have substantial errors, requires modern
approaches. New, fundamental experimental studies that would lead to
deeper insights using more novel systems would be desirable. Further,
biophysics is an interesting field. Recent studies of the selectivity of

forms inverted hexagonal (HII) phases in excess water. DOPC/tetradecane
forms lamellar phases without cholesterol at lower temperatures. With
tetradecane, as little as 5 mol\% cholesterol in DOPC induced the formation
of HII phases of very large dimension. Increasing levels of cholesterol
result in a systematic decrease in the HII lattice dimension for both DOPE
and DOPC in excess water. Using osmotic pressure to control hydration, we
applied a recent prescription to estimate the intrinsic curvature and
bending modulus of the HII monolayers. The radii of the intrinsic
curvature, RPO, at a pivotal plane of constant area within the monolayer
were determined to be 29.4 A for DOPE/tetradecane at 22 degrees C,
decreasing to 27 A at 30 mol\% cholesterol. For DOPC/tetradecane at 32
degrees C, RPO decreased from 62.5 A to 40 A as its cholesterol content
increased from 30 to 50 mol\%. These data yielded an estimate of the
intrinsic radius of curvature for pure DOPC of 87.3 A. The bending moduli
kc of DOPE/tetradecane and DOPC/tetradecane, each with 30 mol\%
cholesterol, are 15 and 9 kT, respectively. Tetradecane itself was shown
to have little effect on the bending modulus in the cases of DOPE and

increase in the kc of these monolayers, which is much smaller than
estimated from its effect on the area compressibility modulus in bilayers.

dynamics of FAs in these cells, we used real-time interference reflection
microscopy (IRM) thus avoiding the need to express exogenous GFP-tagged FA
proteins which may be misregulated. This showed that the FAs were smaller,
less abundant and turned over more rapidly in vinculin null compared to
wild-type cells. Expression of vinculin rescued the spreading defect and
resulted in larger and more stable FAs. Phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is thought to play a role in vinculin activation
by relieving an intramolecular association between the vinculin head (Vh)
and tail (Vt) that masks the ligand binding sites in Vh and Vt. To
investigate the role of the vinculin/PIP2 interaction in FA dynamics, we
used a vinculin mutant lacking the C-terminal arm (residues 1053-1066) and
referred to as the deltaC mutation. This mutation reduced PIP2 binding to
a Vt deltaC polypeptide by {\textgreater}90\% compared to wild type without affecting
binding to Vh or F-actin. Interestingly, cells expressing the vinculin
deltaC mutant assembled remarkably stable FAs. The results suggest that
vinculin inhibits cell migration by stabilising FAs, and that binding of

	abstract = {In purple bacteria, photosynthesis is carried out on large indentations of
the bacterial plasma membrane termed chromatophores. Acting as primitive
organelles, chromatophores are densely packed with the membrane proteins
necessary for photosynthesis, including light harvesting complexes LH1 and
LH2, reaction center (RC), and cytochrome bc(1). The shape of
chromatophores is primarily dependent on species, and is typically
spherical or flat. How these shapes arise from the protein-protein and
protein-membrane interactions is still unknown. Now, using molecular
dynamics simulations, we have observed the dynamic curvature of membranes
caused by proteins in the chromatophore. A membrane-embedded array of LH2s
was found to relax to a curved state, both for LH2 from Rps. acidophila
and a homology-modeled LH2 from Rb. sphaeroides. A modeled LH1-RC-PufX
dimer was found to develop a bend at the dimerizing interface resulting in
a curved shape as well. In contrast, the bc(1) complex, which has not been
imaged yet in native chromatophores, did not induce a preferred membrane
curvature in simulation. Based on these results, a model for how the
different photosynthetic proteins influence chromatophore shape is
presented.},

the allosteric effect of geometrical membrane curvature on transmembrane

the prototypic transmembrane β-barrel α-hemolysin (α-HL) reconstituted on
immobilized single small unilamellar liposomes of different diameter and
therefore curvature. Our data demonstrate that physiologically abundant
geometrical membrane curvatures can enforce a dramatic allosteric
regulation (1000-fold inhibition) of α-HL permeability. High membrane
curvatures (1/diameter {\textasciitilde}1/40 nm(-1)) compressed the effective pore
diameter of α-HL from 14.2 ± 0.8 Å to 11.4 ± 0.6 Å. This reduction in
effective pore area ({\textasciitilde}40\%) when combined with the area compressibility of
α-HL revealed an effective membrane tension of {\textasciitilde}50 mN/m and a
curvature-imposed protein deformation energy of {\textasciitilde}7 kBT. Such substantial
energies have been shown to conformationally activate, or unfold, β-barrel

reported that neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), a member

that N-WASP-mediated invadopodium formation is essential in breast cancer
invasion, intravasation and lung metastasis. We established stable cell
lines based on MTLn3 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells that either
overexpressed a dominant-negative (DN) N-WASP construct or in which N-WASP
expression was silenced by a pSuper N-WASP shRNA. Both the N-WASP shRNA
and DN N-WASP cells showed a markedly decreased ability to form
invadopodia and degrade extracellular matrix. In addition, formation of
invadopodia in primary tumors and collagen I degradation were reduced in
the areas of invasion (collagen-rich areas in the invasive edge of the
tumor) and in the areas of intravasation (blood-vessel-rich areas). Our
results suggest that tumor cells in vivo that have a decreased activity of
N-WASP also have a reduced ability to form invadopodia, migrate, invade,
intravasate and disseminate to lung compared with tumor cells with

(edges) between amino-acid residues (nodes). Here we dissect proteins into
sub-graphs consisting of six nodes and their corresponding edges, with an
edge being either a backbone hydrogen bond (H-bond) or a covalent
interaction. Six thousand three hundred and twenty-two such sub-graphs
were found in a large non-redundant dataset of high-resolution structures,
from which 35 occur much more frequently than in a random model. Many of
these significant sub-graphs (also called network motifs) correspond to
sub-structures of alpha helices and beta-sheets, as expected. However,
others correspond to more exotic sub-structures such as 3(10) helix,
Schellman motif and motifs that were not defined previously. This
topological characterization of patterns is very useful for producing a
detailed differences map to compare protein structures. Here we analyzed
in details the differences between NMR, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations and X-ray structures for Lysozyme, SH3 and the lambda
repressor. In these cases, the same structures solved by NMR and simulated
by MD showed small but consistent differences in their motif composition
from the crystal structures, despite a very small root mean square
deviation (RMSD) between them. This may be due to differences in the
pair-wise energy functions used and the dynamic nature of these proteins.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-risk limits recommended for alcohol consumption vary
substantially across different national guidelines. To define thresholds
associated with lowest risk for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
disease, we studied individual-participant data from 599 912 current
drinkers without previous cardiovascular disease. METHODS: We did a
combined analysis of individual-participant data from three large-scale
data sources in 19 high-income countries (the Emerging Risk Factors
Collaboration, EPIC-CVD, and the UK Biobank). We characterised
dose-response associations and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) per 100 g
per week of alcohol (12·5 units per week) across 83 prospective studies,
adjusting at least for study or centre, age, sex, smoking, and diabetes.
To be eligible for the analysis, participants had to have information
recorded about their alcohol consumption amount and status (ie,
non-drinker vs current drinker), plus age, sex, history of diabetes and
smoking status, at least 1 year of follow-up after baseline, and no
baseline history of cardiovascular disease. The main analyses focused on
current drinkers, whose baseline alcohol consumption was categorised into
eight predefined groups according to the amount in grams consumed per
week. We assessed alcohol consumption in relation to all-cause mortality,
total cardiovascular disease, and several cardiovascular disease subtypes.
We corrected HRs for estimated long-term variability in alcohol
consumption using 152 640 serial alcohol assessments obtained some years
apart (median interval 5·6 years [5th-95th percentile 1·04-13·5]) from 71
011 participants from 37 studies. FINDINGS: In the 599 912 current
drinkers included in the analysis, we recorded 40 310 deaths and 39 018
incident cardiovascular disease events during 5·4 million person-years of
follow-up. For all-cause mortality, we recorded a positive and curvilinear
association with the level of alcohol consumption, with the minimum
mortality risk around or below 100 g per week. Alcohol consumption was
roughly linearly associated with a higher risk of stroke (HR per 100 g per
week higher consumption 1·14, 95\% CI, 1·10-1·17), coronary disease
excluding myocardial infarction (1·06, 1·00-1·11), heart failure (1·09,
1·03-1·15), fatal hypertensive disease (1·24, 1·15-1·33); and fatal aortic
aneurysm (1·15, 1·03-1·28). By contrast, increased alcohol consumption was
log-linearly associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (HR
0·94, 0·91-0·97). In comparison to those who reported drinking {\textgreater}0-≤100 g
per week, those who reported drinking {\textgreater}100-≤200 g per week, {\textgreater}200-≤350 g
per week, or {\textgreater}350 g per week had lower life expectancy at age 40 years of
approximately 6 months, 1-2 years, or 4-5 years, respectively.
INTERPRETATION: In current drinkers of alcohol in high-income countries,
the threshold for lowest risk of all-cause mortality was about 100 g/week.
For cardiovascular disease subtypes other than myocardial infarction,
there were no clear risk thresholds below which lower alcohol consumption
stopped being associated with lower disease risk. These data support
limits for alcohol consumption that are lower than those recommended in
most current guidelines. FUNDING: UK Medical Research Council, British

HIV/AIDS eradication. It binds to protein kinase C competitively with
diacylglycerol, the endogenous protein kinase C regulator, and
plant-derived phorbol esters, but each ligand induces different
activities. Determination of the structural origin for these differing
activities by X-ray analysis has not succeeded due to difficulties in
co-crystallizing protein kinase C with relevant ligands. More importantly,
static, crystal-lattice bound complexes do not address the influence of
the membrane on the structure and dynamics of membrane-associated
proteins. To address this general problem, we performed long-timescale
(400-500 µs aggregate) all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of protein
kinase C-ligand-membrane complexes and observed that different protein
kinase C activators differentially position the complex in the membrane
due in part to their differing interactions with waters at the membrane
inner leaf. These new findings enable new strategies for the design of
simpler, more effective protein kinase C analogs and could also prove
relevant to other peripheral protein complexes.Natural supplies of
bryostatin, a compound in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease, cancer,

	abstract = {Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a protein tyrosine kinase that is
ubiquitously expressed, recruited to focal adhesions, and engages in a
variety of cellular signaling pathways. Diverse cellular responses, such
as cell migration, proliferation, and survival, are regulated by FAK.
Prior to activation, FAK adopts an autoinhibited conformation in which the
FERM domain binds the kinase domain, blocking access to the activation
loop and substrate binding site. Activation of FAK occurs through
conformational change, and acidic phospholipids such as
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are known to facilitate this
process. PIP2 binding alters the autoinhibited conformation of the FERM
and kinase domains and subsequently exposes the activation loop to
phosphorylation. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of PIP2 binding
and its role in FAK activation remain unclear. In this study, we conducted
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding
of FAK to PIP2. Our simulations identified novel areas of basic residues
in the kinase domain of FAK that potentially undergo transient binding to
PIP2 through electrostatic attractions. Our investigation provides a
molecular picture of PIP2-initiated FAK activation and introduces
promising new pathways for future studies of FAK regulation.},

ATL activity or too high Rtn4a concentrations cause ER fragmentation. Lnp
only affects the abundance of three-way junctions and tubules. We suggest
a model in which ATL-mediated fusion counteracts the instability of free
tubule ends. ATL tethers and fuses tubules stabilized by the Rtns, and
transiently sits in newly formed three-way junctions. Lnp subsequently
moves into the junctional sheets and forms oligomers. Lnp is inactivated

many distinct species of SNAREs (Sed5p, Bos1p, Sec22p, Ykt6p, and likely

self-energy, (ii) Coulomb energy, (iii) exchange energy, and (iv)
correlation energy. All structural and dynamic effects emerge from the
interplay of these contributions. The machine learning method kriging
captures well how they change in response to a change in nuclear
configuration. Second, the Coulomb energy is represented by a converging
multipolar series expansion when the nuclei are sufficiently far apart. ?

Observations using bioprobes and peripheral proteins, notably sensors of

broad membrane territories: the territory of loose lipid packing, where
cytosolic proteins take advantage of membrane defects, and the territory
of electrostatics, where proteins are attracted by negatively charged
lipids. The contrasting features of these territories provide specificity
for reactions occurring along the secretory pathway, on the plasma
membrane, and also on lipid droplets and autophagosomes.},

	doi = {10.1016/S0006-3495(96)79337-2},
	abstract = {As sketched in Fig. 1, a current molecular dynamics computer simulation of
a lipid bilayer fails to capture significant features of the macroscopic
system, including long wavelength undulations. Such fluctuations are
intrinsically connected to the value of the macroscopic (or thermodynamic)
surface tension (cf. Eqs. 1 and 9; for a related treatment, see Brochard
et al., 1975, 1976). Consequently, the surface tension that might be
evaluated in an MD simulation should not be expected to equal the surface
tension obtained from macroscopic measurements. Put another way, the
largest of the three simulations presented here contained over 16,000
atoms and required substantial computer time to complete, but modeled a
system of only 36 lipids per side. From this perspective it is not
surprising that the system is not at the thermodynamic limit. An important
practical consequence of this effect is that simulations with fluctuating
area should be carried out with a nonzero applied surface tension (gamma 0
of Fig. 2) even when the macroscopic tension is zero, or close to zero.
Computer simulations at fixed surface area, which can explicitly determine
pressure anisotropy at the molecular level, should ultimately lend insight
into the value of gamma 0, including its dependence on lipid composition
and other membrane components. As we have noted and will describe further
in separate publications (Feller et al., 1996; Feller et al., manuscript
in preparation), surface tensions obtained from simulations can be
distorted by inadequate initial conditions and convergence, and are
sensitive to potential energy functions, force truncation methods, and
system size; it is not difficult, in fact, to tune terms in the potential
energy function so as to yield surface tensions close to zero. This is why
parameters should be tested extensively on simpler systems, for example,
monolayers. The estimates of gamma 0 that we have presented here should be
regarded as qualitative, and primarily underscore the assertion that the
surface tension of a microscopically flat, simulation-sized patch is
significantly greater than zero. As the simulation cell length increases,
the surface tension that would be evaluated (or should be applied)
decreases; in the limit of micrometer-sized simulation cells, gamma would
approach zero or its appropriate thermodynamic value. The theories
presented here also imply that the estimation of bilayer surface tension
from monolayer data should take the degree of flatness into account. These
conclusions are independent of the precise values of parameters such as
bending constants. In conclusion, from the simulator's perspective, the
question "What is the surface tension of a bilayer?" is better phrased as
"What is the value of the applied surface tension necessary to simulate a
particular experimental system with a given number of lipids?". As we have
shown, the answer to the second question varies, but it should not be
assumed a priori to equal zero.},

Furthermore, the size of compositional heterogeneities can be controlled

evaluation of current biomolecular force fields using microsecond-scale
simulations possible. Force fields differ in their treatment of
electrostatic interactions, including the formation of salt bridges in
proteins. Here we conducted an extensive evaluation of salt bridge
interactions in the latest AMBER, CHARMM, and OPLS force fields, using
microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid analogues
in explicit solvent. We focused on salt bridges between three different
pairs of oppositely charged amino acids: Arg/Asp, Lys/Asp, and His(+)/Asp.
Our results reveal considerable variability in the predicted KA values of
the salt bridges for these force fields, as well as differences from
experimental data: almost all of the force fields overestimate the
strengths of the salt bridges. When amino acids are represented by
side-chain analogues, the AMBER ff03 force field overestimates the KA
values the least, while for complete amino acids, the AMBER ff13α force
field yields the lowest KA value, most likely caused by an altered balance
of side-chain/side-chain and side-chain/backbone contacts. These findings
confirm the notion that the implicit incorporation of solvent polarization
improves the accuracy of modeling salt bridge interactions.},

raft-like domains in vitro. In biomembranes the size of lipid rafts is ca.
10-30 nm. In vitro, mixing saturated and unsaturated lipids results in
microdomains, which are unstable and coalesce. This inconsistency is
puzzling. It has been hypothesized that biological line-active surfactants
reduce the line tension between saturated and unsaturated lipids and
stabilize small domains in vivo. Using solution X-ray scattering, we
studied the structure of binary and ternary lipid mixtures in the presence
of calcium ions. Three lipids were used: saturated, unsaturated, and a
hybrid (1-saturated-2-unsaturated) lipid that is predominant in the
phospholipids of cellular membranes. Only membranes composed of the
saturated lipid can adsorb calcium ions, become charged, and therefore
considerably swell. The selective calcium affinity was used to show that
binary mixtures, containing the saturated lipid, phase separated into
large-scale domains. Our data suggests that by introducing the hybrid
lipid to a mixture of the saturated and unsaturated lipids, the size of
the domains decreased with the concentration of the hybrid lipid, until
the three lipids could completely mix. We attribute this behavior to the
tendency of the hybrid lipid to act as a line-active cosurfactant that can
easily reside at the interface between the saturated and the unsaturated
lipids and reduce the line tension between them. These findings are
consistent with a recent theory and provide insight into the
self-organization of lipid rafts, their stabilization, and size regulation
in biomembranes.},

the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily
customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are
incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC,
GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the
interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While
standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language)
and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need
to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of
different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data
stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition
between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats. RESULTS: We
discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox
that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3
interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety
of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide
range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and
aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We
detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3
release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products
and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format
interconversion. CONCLUSIONS: Open Babel presents a solution to the
proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides
a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction,
to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching.
For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical
data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science,
and computational chemistry. It is freely available under an open-source

of 50 nm are phosphorylated 100 times faster than chemically identical
vesicles with an average diameter greater than 300 nm. The low reactivity
of large vesicles is not due to the difference in vesicle number for large

surfaces in multilammelar structures, and can be reversed by addition of
low ({\textless} 1:100) molar ratios of either the PtdIns transfer protein sec14p or
a ten-residue peptide derived from the inositol-phospholipid-binding site
of gelsolin. Similar measurements using PI 4-kinase showed a weak
dependence on vesicle size. The strong dependence of PI 3-kinase function
on membrane curvature suggests possible localization of PI 3-kinase

Molecular motors of the kinesin superfamily contain a kinesin motor domain attached to family-specific sequences for cargo binding, regulation, and oligomerization. The biochemical and biophysical properties of the kinesin motor domain have been widely studied, yet little is known about how kinesin motors work in the complex cellular environment. We discuss recent studies on the three major families involved in intracellular transport (kinesin-1, kinesin-2, and kinesin-3) that have begun to bridge the gap in knowledge between the in vitro and in vivo behaviors of kinesin motors. These studies have increased our understanding of how kinesin subunits assemble to produce a functional motor, how kinesin motors are affected by biochemical cues and obstacles present on cellular microtubules, and how multiple motors on a cargo surface can work collectively for increased force production and travel distance.},

	abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans intestinal epithelium generates rhythmic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3))-dependent Ca(2+) oscillations that control muscle contractions required for defecation. Two highly Ca(2+)-selective transient receptor potential (TRP) melastatin (TRPM) channels, GON-2 and GTL-1, function with PLCgamma in a common signaling pathway that regulates IP(3)-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) release. A second PLC, PLCbeta, is also required for IP(3)-dependent Ca(2+) oscillations, but functions in an independent signaling mechanism. PLCgamma generates IP(3) that regulates IP(3) receptor activity. We demonstrate here that PLCgamma via hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) also regulates GON-2/GTL-1 function. Knockdown of PLCgamma but not PLCbeta activity by RNA interference (RNAi) inhibits channel activity approximately 80\%. Inhibition is fully reversed by agents that deplete PIP(2) levels. PIP(2) added to the patch pipette has no effect on channel activity in PLCgamma RNAi cells. However, in control cells, 10 microM PIP(2) inhibits whole cell current approximately 80\%. Channel inhibition by phospholipids is selective for PIP(2) with an IC(50) value of 2.6 microM. Elevated PIP(2) levels have no effect on channel voltage and Ca(2+) sensitivity and likely inhibit by reducing channel open probability, single-channel conductance, and/or trafficking. We conclude that hydrolysis of PIP(2) by PLCgamma functions in the activation of both the IP(3) receptor and GON-2/GTL-1 channels. GON-2/GTL-1 functions as the major intestinal cell Ca(2+) influx pathway. Calcium influx through the channel feedback regulates its activity and likely functions to modulate IP(3) receptor function. PIP(2)-dependent regulation of GON-2/GTL-1 may provide a mechanism to coordinate plasma membrane Ca(2+) influx with PLCgamma and IP(3) receptor activity as well as intracellular Ca(2+) store depletion.},

	abstract = {Lymphocyte antigen receptor engagement profoundly changes the cellular content of phosphoinositide lipids and soluble inositol phosphates. Among these, the phosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) play key signaling roles by acting as pleckstrin homology (PH) domain ligands that recruit signaling proteins to the plasma membrane. Moreover, PIP2 acts as a precursor for the second messenger molecules diacylglycerol and soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), essential mediators of PKC, Ras/Erk, and Ca2+ signaling in lymphocytes. IP3 phosphorylation by IP3 3-kinases generates inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4), an essential soluble regulator of PH domain binding to PIP3 in developing T cells. Besides PIP2, PIP3, IP3, and IP4, lymphocytes produce multiple other phosphoinositides and soluble inositol phosphates that could have important physiological functions. To aid their analysis, detailed protocols that allow one to simultaneously measure the levels of multiple different phosphoinositide or inositol phosphate isomers in lymphocytes are provided here. They are based on thin layer, conventional and high-performance liquid chromatographic separation methods followed by radiolabeling or non-radioactive metal-dye detection. Finally, less broadly applicable non-chromatographic methods for detection of specific phosphoinositide or inositol phosphate isomers are discussed. Support protocols describe how to obtain pure unstimulated CD4+CD8+ thymocyte populations for analyses of inositol phosphate turnover during positive and negative selection, key steps in T cell development.},

Our molecular dynamics simulations studies show that coverage of the CPPD crystal with a layer of phosphocitrate molecules results in the conservation of phospholipid bilayer integrity. We show that the rupture of the lipid bilayer in presence of CPPD and the protective effect of PC are primarily due to electrostatic interactions. The protective role of PC, which may also play an important and potentially therapeutic function against crystal-induced membranolysis is also discussed.},

	abstract = {The potential physiological relevance of liquid-liquid phase separation in lipid membranes to the formation and stability of "lipid rafts" in cellular plasma membranes has prompted extensive investigation of the physical chemistry underlying these phenomena. In this contribution, the line tension (gamma) and dipole density differences ( micro) between demixed fluid phases of monolayers comprised of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dihydrocholesterol (DChol) were investigated by measuring the two-dimensional thermal fluctuations of domain boundaries visualized by the inclusion of a fluorescent tracer lipid. These parameters are essential determinants of domain stability, and their quantification will yield an increased understanding of the physical processes responsible for aspects of lateral phase separation. Employing an extensive data set, the surface pressure dependence of gamma and mu was determined at three different monolayer compositions (30\%, 35\%, and 40\% DChol). Both parameters were found to decrease with a power law dependence as the surface pressure approached the phase transition pressure (pi t), in agreement with previous measurements. Additionally, photobleaching effects and domain size influence were quantified and found to be small in our system. We suggest that the method of flicker spectroscopy can be helpful in identifying line-active compounds.},

We found that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) was generated at sites of N-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion and was a critical regulator of intercellular adhesion strength. Immunostaining for PI(4,5)P2 or transfection with GFP-PH-PLCdelta showed that PI(4,5)P2 was enriched at sites of N-cadherin adhesions and this enrichment required activated Rac1. Isoform-specific immunostaining for type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 kinase (PIP5KI) showed that PIP5KIgamma was spatially associated with N-cadherin-Fc beads. Association of PIP5KIgamma with N-cadherin adhesions was in part dependent on the activation of RhoA. Transfection with catalytically inactive PIP5KIgamma blocked the enrichment of PI(4,5)P2 around beads. Catalytically inactive PIP5KIgamma or a cell-permeant peptide that mimics and competes for the PI(4,5)P2-binding region of the actin-binding protein gelsolin inhibited incorporation of actin monomers in response to N-cadherin ligation and reduced intercellular adhesion strength by more than twofold. Gelsolin null fibroblasts transfected with a gelsolin severing mutant containing an intact PI(4,5)P2 binding region, demonstrated intercellular adhesion strength similar to wild-type transfected controls. We conclude that PIP5KIgamma-mediated generation of PI(4,5)P2 at sites of N-cadherin contacts regulates intercellular adhesion strength, an effect due in part to PI(4,5)P2-mediated regulation of gelsolin.},

Multiple minima were obtained for the ring twist (analogous to roll for an airplane). The phosphates at position 1 of PIP2 and PIP3 are within an Ångström of the plane formed by the phosphates of POPC; lipids in the surrounding shell are depressed by 0.5-0.8 Å, but otherwise the phosphoinositides do not substantially perturb the bilayer. Finite size artifacts for ion distributions are apparent for systems of {\textasciitilde}26 waters/lipid, but, based on simulations with a fourfold increase of the aqueous phase, the phosphoinositide positions and orientations do not show significant size effects. Electrostatic potentials evaluated from Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) calculations show a strong dependence of potential height and ring orientation, with the maxima on the -25 mV surfaces (17.1 ± 0.1 Å for PIP2 and 19.4 ± 0.3 Å for PIP3) occurring near the most populated orientations from MD. These surfaces are well above the background height of 10 Å estimated for negatively charged cell membranes, as would be expected for lipids involved in cellular signaling. PB calculations on microscopically flat bilayers yield similar maxima as the MD-based (microscopically rough) systems, but show less fine structure and do not clearly indicate the most probable regions. Electrostatic free energies of interaction with pentalysine are also similar for the rough and flat systems. These results support the utility of a rigid/flat bilayer model for PB-based studies of PIP2 and PIP3 as long as the orientations are judiciously chosen.},

central interest in early-stage drug-discovery, and there is a widely
recognized need for improved methods. Low molecular weight receptors and
their ligands--i.e., host-guest systems--represent valuable test-beds for
such affinity prediction methods, because their small size makes for fast
calculations and relatively facile numerical convergence. The SAMPL3
community exercise included the first ever blind prediction challenge for
host-guest binding affinities, through the incorporation of 11 new
host-guest complexes. Ten participating research groups addressed this
challenge with a variety of approaches. Statistical assessment indicates
that, although most methods performed well at predicting some general
trends in binding affinity, overall accuracy was not high, as all the
methods suffered from either poor correlation or high RMS errors or both.
There was no clear advantage in using explicit versus implicit solvent
models, any particular force field, or any particular approach to
conformational sampling. In a few cases, predictions using very similar
energy models but different sampling and/or free-energy methods resulted
in significantly different results. The protonation states of one host and
some guest molecules emerged as key uncertainties beyond the choice of
computational approach. The present results have implications for methods
development and future blind prediction exercises.},

cell biological processes. However, precise biochemical or genetic
manipulation of these often complex structures is laborious and hampers
experimental structure-function studies. Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations provide a valuable alternative tool to generate and test
hypotheses on saccharide function. Yet, currently used MD force fields
often overestimate the aggregation propensity of polysaccharides,
affecting the usability of those simulations. Here we tested MARTINI, a
popular coarse-grained (CG) force field for biological macromolecules, for
its ability to accurately represent molecular forces between saccharides.
To this end, we calculated a thermodynamic solution property, the second
virial coefficient of the osmotic pressure (B22). Comparison with light
scattering experiments revealed a nonphysical aggregation of a
prototypical polysaccharide in MARTINI, pointing at an imbalance of the
nonbonded solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water interactions. This
finding also applies to smaller oligosaccharides which were all found to
aggregate in simulations even at moderate concentrations, well below their
solubility limit. Finally, we explored the influence of the Lennard-Jones
(LJ) interaction between saccharide molecules and propose a simple scaling
of the LJ interaction strength that makes MARTINI more reliable for the
simulation of saccharides.},

challenging to reliably achieve the level of accuracy that would be needed
to guide lead optimization (\${\textbackslash}sim\$5× in binding affinity) for a wide range
of ligands and protein targets. Not surprisingly, widespread commercial
application of free-energy simulations has been limited due to the lack of
large-scale validation coupled with the technical challenges traditionally
associated with running these types of calculations. Here, we report an
approach that achieves an unprecedented level of accuracy across a broad
range of target classes and ligands, with retrospective results
encompassing 200 ligands and a wide variety of chemical perturbations,
many of which involve significant changes in ligand chemical structures.
In addition, we have applied the method in prospective drug discovery
projects and found a significant improvement in the quality of the
compounds synthesized that have been predicted to be potent. Compounds
predicted to be potent by this approach have a substantial reduction in
false positives relative to compounds synthesized on the basis of other

	abstract = {Biomimetic systems such as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are
increasingly used for studying protein/lipid interactions due to their
size (similar to that of cells) and to their ease of observation by light
microscopy techniques. Biophysicists have begun to complexify GUVs to
investigate lipid/protein interactions. In particular, composite GUVs have
been designed that incorporate lipids that play important physiological
roles in cellulo, such as phosphoinositides and among those the most
abundant one, phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate (PIP2). Fluorescent
lipids are often used as tracers to observe GUV membranes by microscopy
but they can not bring quantitative information about the insertion of
unlabeled lipids. In this study, we carried out zeta-potential
measurements to prove the effective incorporation of PIP2 as well as that
of phosphatidylserine in the membrane of GUVs prepared by electroformation
and to follow the stability of PIP2-containing GUVs. Using confocal
microscopy, we found that long-chain (C16) fluorescent PIP2 analogs used
as tracers (0.1\% of total lipids) show a uniform distribution in the
membrane whereas PIP2 antibodies show PIP2 clustering. However, the
clustering effect, which is emphasized when tertiary antibodies are used

more than 100 kcal/mol to every cellular fission or fusion event. This
huge impact on membrane remodeling energetics might be a factor that
codetermines the complex lipid composition of biomembranes through tuning
of κ¯. Yet, its value has been measured only for a handful of simple
lipids, and no simulation has so far determined it better than a factor of
two, rendering a systematic investigation of such enticing speculations
impossible. Here we propose a highly accurate method to determine κ¯ in
computer simulations. It relies on the interplay between curvature stress
and edge tension of partially curved axisymmetric membrane disks and
requires determining their closing probability. For a simplified lipid
model we obtain κ¯ and its relation to the normal bending modulus κ for
membranes differing both in stiffness and spontaneous lipid curvature. The
elastic ratio κ¯/κ can be determined with a few percent statistical
accuracy. Its value agrees with the scarce experimental data, and its
change with spontaneous lipid curvature is compatible with theoretical
expectations, thereby granting additional information on monolayer
properties. We also show that an alternative determination of these
elastic parameters based on moments of the lateral stress profile gives
markedly different and unphysical values.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The loss of E-cadherin based cell-cell contacts and tumor
cell migration to the vasculature and lymphatic system are hallmarks of
metastasis of epithelial cancers. Type I gamma phosphatidylinositol
phosphate kinase (PIPKIgamma), an enzyme that generates
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) a lipid messenger and
precursor to many additional second messengers, was found to regulate
E-cadherin cell-cell contacts and growth factor-stimulated directional
cell migration, indicating that PIPKIgamma regulates key steps in
metastasis. Here, we assess the expression of PIPKIgamma in breast cancers
and have shown that expression correlated with disease progression and
outcome. METHODS: Using a tissue microarray, we analyzed 438 breast
carcinomas for the levels of PIPKIgamma and investigated the correlation
of PIPKIgamma expression with patient survival via Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis. Moreover, via knockdown of the expression of PIPKIgamma in
cultured breast cancer cells with siRNA, the roles of PIPKIgamma in breast
cancer migration, invasion, and proliferation were examined. RESULTS:
Tissue microarray data shows that approximately 18\% of the cohort
immunostained showed high expression of PIPKIgamma. The Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between
strong PIPKIgamma expression and overall patient survival. Expression of
PIPKIgamma correlated positively with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) expression, which regulates breast cancer progression and
metastasis. In cultured breast cancer cells, PIPKIgamma is required for
growth factor stimulated migration, invasion, and proliferation of cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal a significant correlation between
PIPKIgamma expression and the progression of breast cancer. This is
consistent with PIPKIgamma 's role in breast cancer cell migration,
invasion, and proliferation.},

membranes via a charged concave surface and N-terminal amphipathic

the N-BAR domain can induce a strong local curvature that matches the
curvature of the BAR domain surface facing the bilayer. Here we present
further molecular dynamics simulations that examine in greater detail the
roles of the concave surface and amphipathic helices in driving local
membrane curvature. We find that the strong curvature induction observed
in our previous simulations requires the stable presentation of the
charged concave surface to the membrane and is not driven by the
membrane-embedded amphipathic helices. Nevertheless, without these
amphipathic helices embedded in the membrane, the N-BAR domain does not
maintain a close association with the bilayer, and fails to drive membrane
curvature. Increasing the membrane negative charge through the addition of
PIP(2) facilitates closer association with the membrane in the absence of
embedded helices. At sufficiently high concentrations, amphipathic helices
embedded in the membrane drive membrane curvature independently of the BAR
domain.},

	abstract = {Epsin possesses a conserved epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain that
acts as a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-lipid-targeting and
membrane-curvature-generating element. Upon binding phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate, the N-terminal helix (H(0)) of the ENTH domain becomes
structured and aids in the aggregation of ENTH domains, which results in
extensive membrane remodeling. In this article, atomistic and
coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to
investigate the structure and the stability of ENTH domain aggregates on
lipid bilayers. EPR experiments are also reported for systems composed of
different ENTH-bound membrane morphologies, including membrane vesicles as
well as preformed membrane tubules. The EPR data are used to help develop
a molecular model of ENTH domain aggregates on preformed lipid tubules
that are then studied by CG MD simulation. The combined computational and
experimental approach suggests that ENTH domains exist predominantly as
monomers on vesiculated structures, while ENTH domains self-associate into
dimeric structures and even higher-order oligomers on the membrane tubes.
The results emphasize that the arrangement of ENTH domain aggregates
depends strongly on whether the local membrane curvature is isotropic or
anisotropic. The molecular mechanism of ENTH-domain-induced membrane
vesiculation and tubulation and the implications of the epsin's role in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis resulting from the interplay between ENTH
domain membrane binding and ENTH domain self-association are also
discussed.},

Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by

calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small

1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with
experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter
optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers
at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC,
1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC),
1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC),
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC),

1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a
low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with
experimental surface area is on average within 2\%, and the density
profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR
deuterium order parameters (S(CD)) are well predicted with the new FF,

to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area
compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of (13)C NMR relaxation
rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers
also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF,

study phase separation in mixed monolayers of neutral and highly

1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine and simulations of a simplified

In addition, we find numerically that under certain conditions the
effective attractions can rigidify the resulting clusters. Our results
support an interpretation of PIP(2) clustering as governed primarily by
electrostatic interactions. At physiological pH, the simulations suggest
that the effective attractions are strong enough to give nearly pure

glycerolmonoolein bilayer molecular dynamics simulations in which the
surface area and system size were systematically changed have been
conducted. Systems ranging from 200 to 1800 lipids were simulated,
covering length scales up to 20 nm. The dependence of the surface tension
on the area per lipid is shown, although long simulation times were needed
(up to 40 ns) to obtain reliable estimates. As the size of simulated
patches increases, long wavelength undulatory modes appear with a
concomitant increase in the area compressibility due to coupling of
undulation modes to area fluctuations. Both the undulatory intensities and
the peristaltic intensities of the bilayer fluctuations can be fitted in
the long wavelength limit to continuum model predictions. The effect of
system size on surface tension appears to depend on the stress conditions.},

	abstract = {Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are small protein modules of around 120
amino acids found in many proteins involved in cell signalling,
cytoskeletal rearrangement and other processes. Although several different
protein ligands have been proposed for PH domains, their only clearly
demonstrated physiological function to date is to bind membrane
phosphoinositides. The PH domain from phospholipase C-delta(1) binds
specifically to PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and its headgroup, and has become a
valuable tool for studying cellular PtdIns(4,5)P(2) functions. More recent
developments have demonstrated that a subset of PH domains recognizes the
products of agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide 3-kinases. Fusion of these
PH domains to green fluorescent protein has allowed dramatic
demonstrations of their independent ability to drive signal-dependent
recruitment of their host proteins to the plasma membrane. We discuss the
structural basis for this 3-phosphoinoistide recognition and the role that
it plays in cellular signalling. PH domains that bind specifically to
phosphoinositides comprise only a minority (perhaps 15\%) of those known,
raising questions as to the physiological role of the remaining 85\% of PH
domains. Most (if not all) PH domains bind weakly and non-specifically to
phosphoinositides. Studies of dynamin-1 have indicated that
oligomerization of its PH domain may be important in driving membrane
association. We discuss the possibility that membrane targeting by PH
domains with low affinity for phosphoinositides could be driven by
alteration of their oligomeric state and thus the avidity of their
membrane binding.},

membrane heterogeneities, or domains, supposed to be important for

Characterization of membrane lipid heterogeneities in live cells has been
challenging in part because inhomogeneity has not usually been definable
by optical microscopy. Model membrane systems, including giant unilamellar
vesicles, allow optical fluorescence discrimination of coexisting lipid
phase types, but thus far have focused on coexisting optically resolvable
fluid phases in simple lipid mixtures. Here we demonstrate that giant
plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) or blebs formed from the plasma membranes
of cultured mammalian cells can also segregate into micrometer-scale fluid
phase domains. Phase segregation temperatures are widely spread, with the
vast majority of GPMVs found to form optically resolvable domains only at
temperatures below approximately 25 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, these GPMV
membranes are almost exclusively optically homogenous. At room
temperature, we find diagnostic lipid phase fluorophore partitioning
preferences in GPMVs analogous to the partitioning behavior now
established in model membrane systems with liquid-ordered and
liquid-disordered fluid phase coexistence. We image these GPMVs for direct
visual characterization of protein partitioning between coexisting
liquid-ordered-like and liquid-disordered-like membrane phases in the
absence of detergent perturbation. For example, we find that the
transmembrane IgE receptor FcepsilonRI preferentially segregates into
liquid-disordered-like phases, and we report the partitioning of
additional well known membrane associated proteins. Thus, GPMVs now
provide an effective approach to characterize biological membrane
heterogeneities.},

form 6-nm diameter micelles in water, but aggregate into larger,
multilamellar structures in physiological concentrations of divalent

they are clusters of striated filaments, suggesting that PIP2 aggregates
form stacks of discoid micelles rather than multilamellar vesicles or
inverted hexagonal arrays as previously inferred from indirect
observations. The distance between striations within the filaments varies
from 4.2 to 5.4 nm and the diameter of the filaments depends on the
dehydrated ionic radius of the divalent cation, with average diameters of
19, 12, and 10 nm for filaments formed by Mg2+, Ca2+, and Ba2+,
respectively. The structure of the divalent cation-induced aggregates can
be altered by PIP2 binding proteins. Gelsolin and the microtubule
associated protein tau both affect the formation of aggregates, indicating
that tau acts as a PIP2 binding protein in a manner similar to gelsolin.
In contrast, another PIP2 binding protein, profilin, does not modify the

describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of

evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used.
Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating
both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented.
The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD,
implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined.
The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation
are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with
representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular
system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl
scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features
of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular

co-reconstitution of PIP2 and the carboxy-terminal part of syntaxin-1A in
artificial giant unilamellar vesicles resulted in segregation of PIP2 and

organized by intimate interdomain interactions to form characteristic
grooves and clefts. One such groove is negatively charged and so is
thought to interact with basic juxta-membrane regions of adhesion
proteins. IP3 binds a basic cleft that is distinct from those of
pleckstrin homology domains and is located on a positively charged flat
molecular surface, suggesting an electrostatic mechanism of plasma

dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers were analyzed for
fluctuations perpendicular to the bilayer using a completely Fourier-based
method. We find that the fluctuation spectrum of motions perpendicular to
the bilayer can be decomposed into just two parts: 1), a pure undulation
spectrum proportional to q(-4) that dominates in the small-q regime; and
2), a molecular density structure factor contribution that dominates in
the large-q regime. There is no need for a term proportional to q(-2) that
has been postulated for protrusion fluctuations and that appeared to have
been necessary to fit the spectrum for intermediate q. We suggest that
earlier reports of such a term were due to the artifact of binning and
smoothing in real space before obtaining the Fourier spectrum. The
observability of an intermediate protrusion regime from the fluctuation
spectrum is discussed based on measured and calculated material constants.},

	abstract = {The plasma membrane and the underlying cortical actin cytoskeleton undergo continuous dynamic interplay that is responsible for many essential aspects of cell physiology. Polymerization of actin filaments against cellular membranes provides the force for a number of cellular processes such as migration, morphogenesis, and endocytosis. Plasma membrane phosphoinositides (especially phosphatidylinositol bis- and trisphosphates) play a central role in regulating the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton by acting as platforms for protein recruitment, by triggering signaling cascades, and by directly regulating the activities of actin-binding proteins. Furthermore, a number of actin-associated proteins, such as BAR domain proteins, are capable of directly deforming phosphoinositide-rich membranes to induce plasma membrane protrusions or invaginations. Recent studies have also provided evidence that the actin cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interactions are misregulated in a number of pathological conditions such as cancer and during pathogen invasion. Here, we summarize the wealth of knowledge on how the cortical actin cytoskeleton is regulated by phosphoinositides during various cell biological processes. We also discuss the mechanisms by which interplay between actin dynamics and certain membrane deforming proteins regulate the morphology of the plasma membrane.},

We distributed the released energy to atoms located around the ATPase pocket as kinetic energies and examined how the effect of disturbance extended throughout the motor domain. The result showed that the disturbance signal extended over the motor domain in 150 ps and induced slowly varying collective motions of atoms at the actin-binding site and the junction with the neck, both of which are relevant to the movement of the myosin head along the actin filament. We also performed a principal component analysis of thermal atomic motions for the motor domain, and the first principal component was consistent with the response to the disturbance given to the ATPase pocket.},

Starting from a recently solved crystal structure of ATP-like kinesin-tubulin complex by the Knossow lab, we have used flexible fitting of cryo-electron-microscopy maps to construct new structural models of the kinesin-tubulin complex in APO and ATP state, and then conducted extensive MD simulations (total 400 ns for each state), followed by flexibility analysis, principal component analysis, hydrogen bond analysis, and binding free energy analysis. Our modeling and simulation have revealed key nucleotide-dependent changes in the structure and flexibility of the nucleotide-binding pocket (featuring a highly flexible and open switch I in APO state) and the tubulin-binding site, and allosterically coupled motions driving the APO to ATP transition. In addition, our binding free energy analysis has identified a set of key residues involved in kinesin-tubulin binding. On the basis of our simulation, we have attempted to address several outstanding issues in kinesin study, including the possible roles of β-sheet twist and neck linker docking in regulating nucleotide release and binding, the structural mechanism of ADP release, and possible extension and shortening of α4 helix during the ATPase cycle. This study has provided a comprehensive structural and dynamic picture of kinesin's major ATPase states, and offered promising targets for future mutational and functional studies to investigate the molecular mechanism of kinesin motors.},

	abstract = {Membrane lipids are active contributors to cell function as key mediators in signaling pathways controlling cell functions including inflammation, apoptosis, migration, and proliferation. Recent work on multimolecular lipid structures suggests a critical role for lipid organization in regulating the function of both lipids and proteins. Of particular interest in this context are the polyphosphoinositides (PPI's), especially phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP 2). The cellular functions of PIP 2 are numerous but the organization of PIP 2 in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, as well as the factors controlling targeting of PIP 2 to specific proteins, remains poorly understood. To analyze the organization of PIP 2 in a simplified planar system, we used Langmuir monolayers to study the effects of subphase conditions on monolayers of purified naturally derived PIP 2 and other anionic or zwitterionic phospholipids. We report a significant molecular area expanding effect of subphase monovalent salts on PIP 2 at biologically relevant surface densities. This effect is shown to be specific to PIP 2 and independent of subphase pH. Chaotropic agents (e.g., salts, trehalose, urea, temperature) that disrupt water structure and the ability of water to mediate intermolecular hydrogen bonding also specifically expanded PIP 2 monolayers. These results suggest a combination of water-mediated hydrogen bonding and headgroup repulsion in determining the organization of PIP 2, and may contribute to an explanation for the unique functionality of PIP 2 compared to other anionic phospholipids.},

	abstract = {Movement is intrinsic to life. Biologists have established that most forms of directed nanoscopic, microscopic and, ultimately, macroscopic movements are powered by molecular motors from the dynein, myosin and kinesin superfamilies. These motor proteins literally walk, step by step, along polymeric filaments, carrying out essential tasks such as organelle transport. In the last few years biological molecular walkers have inspired the development of artificial systems that mimic aspects of their dynamics. Several DNA-based molecular walkers have been synthesised and shown to walk directionally along a track upon sequential addition of appropriate chemical fuels. In other studies, autonomous operation--i.e. DNA-walker migration that continues as long as a complex DNA fuel is present--has been demonstrated and sophisticated tasks performed, such as moving gold nanoparticles from place-to-place and assistance in sequential chemical synthesis. Small-molecule systems, an order of magnitude smaller in each dimension and 1000× smaller in molecular weight than biological motor proteins or the walker systems constructed from DNA, have also been designed and operated such that molecular fragments can be progressively transported directionally along short molecular tracks. The small-molecule systems can be powered by light or chemical fuels. In this critical review the biological motor proteins from the kinesin, myosin and dynein families are analysed as systems from which the designers of synthetic systems can learn, ratchet concepts for transporting Brownian substrates are discussed as the mechanisms by which molecular motors need to operate, and the progress made with synthetic DNA and small-molecule walker systems reviewed (142 references).},

We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an RMS error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the RMS error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.},

	abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate lipids (phosphoinositides) form only a minor pool of membrane phospholipids but are involved in many intracellular signaling processes, including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal remodeling, and receptor signal transduction. Phosphoinositide properties are largely determined by the characteristics of their headgroup, which at physiological pH is highly charged but also capable of forming hydrogen bonds. Many proteins have developed special binding domains that facilitate specific binding to particular phosphoinositides, while other proteins interact with phosphoinositides via nonspecific electrostatic interactions. Despite its importance, only limited information is available about the ionization properties of phosphoinositides. We have investigated the pH-dependent ionization behavior of all three naturally occurring phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates as well as of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in mixed phosphoinositide/phosphatidylcholine vesicles using magic angle spinning 31P NMR spectroscopy. For phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, where the two phosphomonoester groups are separated by a hydroxyl group at the 4-position, the pH-dependent chemical shift variation can be fitted with a Henderson−Hasselbalch-type formalism, yielding pKa2 values of 6.96 ± 0.04 and 6.58 ± 0.04 for the 3- and 5-phosphates, respectively. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2] as well as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] show a biphasic pH-dependent ionization behavior that cannot be explained by a Henderson−Hasselbalch-type formalism. This biphasic behavior can be attributed to the sharing of the last remaining proton between the vicinal phosphomonoester groups. At pH 7.0, the overall charge (including the phosphodiester group charge) is found to be −3.96 ± 0.10 for PI(3,4)P2 and −3.99 ± 0.10 for PI(4,5)P2. While for PI(3,5)P2 and PI(4,5)P2 the charges of the individual phosphate groups in the molecule differ, they are equal for PI(3,4)P2. Differences in the charges of the phosphomonoester groups can be rationalized on the basis of the ability of the respective phosphomonoester group to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with adjacent hydroxyl groups. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate shows an extraordinary complex ionization behavior. While at pH 4 the 31P NMR peak of the 4-phosphate is found downfield from the other two phosphomonoester group peaks, an increase in pH leads to a crossover of the 4-phosphate, which positions this peak eventually upfield from the other two peaks. As a result, the 4-phosphate group shows a significantly lower charge at pH values between 7 and 9.5 than the other two phosphomonoester groups. The charge of the respective phosphomonoester group in PI(3,4,5)P3 is lower than the corresponding charge of the phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate phosphomonoester groups, leading to an overall charge of PI(3,4,5)P3 of −5.05 ± 0.15 at pH 7.0. The charge of all investigated phosphoinositides at pH 7.0 is equal or higher than the corresponding charge of soluble inositol polyphosphate headgroup analogues, which is the opposite of what is expected on the basis of simple electrostatic considerations. This higher than expected headgroup charge can be rationalized with mutual intermolecular hydrogen bond formation. Measurements using different concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 in the lipid vesicles (1, 5, and 20 mol \%) did not reveal any significant concentration-dependent shift of the two phosphomonoester peaks, suggesting that PI(4,5)P2 is clustered even at 1 mol \%.},

Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-\textit{disp}, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation.

	abstract = {Molecular motors are thought to generate force and directional motion via nonequilibrium switching between energy surfaces. Because all enzymes can undergo such switching, we hypothesized that the ability to generate rotary motion and torque is not unique to highly adapted biological motor proteins but is instead a common feature of enzymes. We used molecular dynamics simulations to compute energy surfaces for hundreds of torsions in three enzymes—adenosine kinase, protein kinase A, and HIV-1 protease—and used these energy surfaces within a kinetic model that accounts for intersurface switching and intrasurface probability flows. When substrate is out of equilibrium with product, we find computed torsion rotation rates up ∼140 cycles s−1, with stall torques up to ∼2 kcal mol−1 cycle−1, and power outputs up to ∼50 kcal mol−1 s−1. We argue that these enzymes are instances of a general phenomenon of directional probability flows on asymmetric energy surfaces for systems out of equilibrium. Thus, we conjecture that cyclic probability fluxes, corresponding to rotations of torsions and higher-order collective variables, exist in any chiral molecule driven between states in a nonequilibrium manner; we call this the “Asymmetry-Directionality” conjecture. This is expected to apply as well to synthetic chiral molecules switched in a nonequilibrium manner between energy surfaces by light, redox chemistry, or catalysis.},

	abstract = {Molecular mechanics force fields define how the energy and forces of a molecular system are computed from its atomic positions, and enable the study of such systems through computational methods like molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. Despite progress toward automated force field parameterization, considerable human expertise is required to develop or extend force fields. In particular, human input has long been required to define \textit{atom types}, which encode chemically unique environments that determine which parameters must be assigned. However, relying on humans to establish atom types is suboptimal: the resulting atom types are often unjustified from a statistical perspective, leading to over- or under-fitting; they are difficult to extend in a systematic and consistent manner when new chemistries must be modeled or new data becomes available; and human effort is not scalable when force fields must be generated for new (bio)polymers or materials. We aim to replace human specification of atom types with an automated approach, based on solid statistics and driven by experimental and/or quantum chemical reference data. Here, we describe a novel technology for this purpose, termed \textit{SMARTY}, which generalizes atom typing by using direct chemical perception with SMARTS strings, and adopting a hierarchical approach to type assignment. The SMARTY technology enables creation of a move set in atom-typing space that can be used in a Monte Carlo optimization approach to atom typing. We demonstrate the power of this approach with a fully automated procedure that is able to re-discover human-defined atom types in the traditional small molecule force field parm99/parm@Frosst. Furthermore, we show how an extension of this approach that makes use of SMIRKS strings to match multiple atoms, which we term \textit{SMIRKY}, allows us to take full advantage of the advances in direct chemical perception for valence types (bonds, angles, and torsions) afforded by the recently-proposed SMIRNOFF direct chemical perception force field typing language. We assess these approaches using several molecular datasets, including one which covers a diverse molecular subset from DrugBank.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses calculations of the standard free energy of binding from molecular simulations in which a bound ligand is extracted from its binding site by steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or equilibrium umbrella sampling. Host-guest systems are used as test beds to examine the requirements for obtaining the reversible work of ligand extraction. We find that, for both steered MD and umbrella sampling, marked irreversibilities can occur when the guest molecule crosses an energy barrier and suddenly jumps to a new position, causing dissipation of energy stored in the stretched molecule(s). For flexible molecules, this occurs even when a stiff pulling spring is employed, and it is difficult to suppress in calculations where the spring is attached to the molecules by single, fixed attachment points. We therefore introduce and test a method, Fluctuation-Guided Pulling (FGP), which adaptively adjusts the spring's attachment points based on the guest's atomic fluctuations relative to the host. This adaptive approach is found to substantially improve the reversibility of both steered MD and umbrella sampling calculations for the present systems. The results are then used to estimate standard binding free energies within a comprehensive framework, termed attach-pull-release (APR), which recognizes that the standard free energy of binding must include not only the pulling work itself, but also the work of attaching and then releasing the spring, where the release work includes an accounting of the standard concentration to which the ligand is discharged.},

The angle between the headgroup and the acyl chains is nearly perpendicular, suggesting that in the absence of other interactions, the inositol ring would lie flat along the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. Next, we employed hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations to investigate the protonation state of PIP2 and its interactions with magnesium or calcium. We test the hypothesis suggested by prior experiments that binding of magnesium to PIP2 is mediated by a water molecule that is absent when calcium binds.

	abstract = {The most highly charged phospholipids, polyphosphoinositides, are often involved in signaling pathways that originate at cell–cell and cell–matrix contacts, and different isomers of polyphosphoinositides have distinct biological functions that cannot be explained by separate highly specific protein ligand binding sites [Lemmon, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol., 2008, 9, 99–111]. PtdIns(3,5)P2 is a low abundance phosphoinositide localized to cytoplasmic-facing membrane surfaces, with relatively few known ligands, yet PtdIns(3,5)P2 plays a key role in controlling membrane trafficking events and cellular stress responses that cannot be duplicated by other phosphoinositides [Dove et al., Nature, 1997, 390, 187–192; Michell, FEBS J., 2013, 280, 6281–6294]. Here we show that PtdIns(3,5)P2 is structurally distinct from PtdIns(4,5)P2 and other more common phospholipids, with unique physical chemistry. Using multiscale molecular dynamics techniques on the quantum level, single molecule, and in bilayer settings, we found that the negative charge of PtdIns(3,5)P2 is spread over a larger area, compared to PtdIns(4,5)P2, leading to a decreased ability to bind divalent ions. Additionally, our results match well with experimental data characterizing the cluster forming potential of these isomers in the presence of Ca2+ [Wang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 3387–3395; van den Bogaart et al., Nature, 2011, 479, 552–555]. Our results demonstrate that the different cellular roles of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,5)P2in vivo are not simply determined by their localization by enzymes that produce or degrade them, but also by their molecular size, ability to chelate ions, and the partial dehydration of those ions, which might affect the ability of PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2 to form phosphoinositide-rich clusters in vitro and in vivo.},

	abstract = {Phosphoinositides like phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are negatively charged lipids that play a pivotal role in membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and protein anchoring. We have designed a force field for the PIP2 headgroup using quantum mechanical methods and characterized its properties inside a lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulations. Macroscopic properties such as area/headgroup, density profiles, and lipid order parameters calculated from these simulations agree well with the experimental values. However, microscopically, the PIP2 introduces a local perturbation of the lipid bilayer. The average PIP2 headgroup orientation of 45° relative to the bilayer normal induces a unique, distance-dependent organization of the lipids that surround PIP2. The headgroups of these lipids preferentially orient closer to the bilayer normal. This perturbation creates a PIP2 lipid microdomain with the neighboring lipids. We propose that the PIP2 lipid microdomain enables the PIP2 to function as a membrane-bound anchoring molecule.},

The main challenge lies in the calculation of entropic contribution to protein?ligand binding or interaction systems. In this report, we present a new interaction entropy method which is theoretically rigorous, computationally efficient, and numerically reliable for calculating entropic contribution to free energy in protein?ligand binding and other interaction processes. Drastically different from the widely employed but extremely expensive normal mode method for calculating entropy change in protein?ligand binding, the new method calculates the entropic component (interaction entropy or ?T?S) of the binding free energy directly from molecular dynamics simulation without any extra computational cost. Extensive study of over a dozen randomly selected protein?ligand binding systems demonstrated that this interaction entropy method is both computationally efficient and numerically reliable and is vastly superior to the standard normal mode approach. This interaction entropy paradigm introduces a novel and intuitive conceptual understanding of the entropic effect in protein?ligand binding and other general interaction systems as well as a practical method for highly efficient calculation of this effect.},

	abstract = {Author Summary For the communication between two nerve cells, a synaptic vesicle containing neurotransmitters has to fuse with the neuronal membrane at a specific fusion site, releasing its signaling molecules. The vesicle fusion is mediated by a specific family of proteins (SNAREs) that are located on the vesicle as well as on the neuronal membrane. As many other membrane proteins, SNARE proteins are not uniformly distributed over the membrane but rather exist in complexes or clusters. Syntaxin, one of the SNARE proteins, is known to form such clusters through attractive protein-protein interactions. With the help of light microscopy techniques we show that the actual size and abundance of these clusters depends on its proximity to the fusion site on the membrane. We developed a computational model of Syntaxin cluster formation that can explain the observed differences in clustering and allow us to speculate on their potential role in the process of docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles. The formation of clusters through weak protein-protein interactions allow for a highly dynamic behavior of proteins, being able to easily switch between a state with stable and almost immobile clusters and a more dynamic situation with clusters exchanging particles at high rates.},

In model membranes, PIP2 has been reported to form clusters, but whether these locally different conditions could give rise to distinct pools of unclustered and clustered PIP2 is unclear. By use of both fluorescence self-quenching and Förster resonance energy transfer assays, we have discovered that PIP2 self-associates at remarkably low concentrations starting below 0.05 mol\% of total lipids. Formation of these clusters was dependent on physiological divalent metal ions, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, or trivalent ions Fe3+ and Al3+. Formation of PIP2 clusters was also headgroup-specific, being largely independent of the type of acyl chain. The similarly labeled phospholipids phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol exhibited no such clustering. However, six phosphoinositide species coclustered with PIP2. The degree of PIP2 cation clustering was significantly influenced by the composition of the surrounding lipids, with cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol enhancing this behavior. We propose that PIP2 cation-bridged cluster formation, which might be similar to micelle formation, can be used as a physical model for what could be distinct pools of PIP2 in biological membranes. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of PIP2 forming clusters at such low concentrations. The property of PIP2 to form such clusters at such extremely low concentrations in model membranes reveals, to our knowledge, a new behavior of PIP2 proposed to occur in cells, in which local multivalent metal ions, lipid compositions, and various binding proteins could greatly influence PIP2 properties. In turn, these different pools of PIP2 could further regulate cellular events.},

Macroscopic motors rely on gears to keep components in synchrony. Štacko et al. demonstrate an analogous type of coupled motion at the molecular scale (see the Perspective by Baroncini and Credi). They constructed a molecular scaffold in which light absorption drives the rotation of upper and lower fragments around a connecting double bond. At the same time, steric constraints modulate the motion of a third component that is tethered to the top of the rotor, so that it continuously exposes the same face to the bottom. The design paves the way toward more complex synchronized motion in an assembly of molecular machines.
Science, this issue p. 964; see also p. 906
Biological molecular motors translate their local directional motion into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that couple motion in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary motion to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving coupled motion of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous motion, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.
Light-driven rotation of two components in a molecular motor couples synchronously with the motion of a third component.

The most abundant and best characterized phosphoinositide species are phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and its main precursor, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 regulate various structural and developmental functions but are also centrally involved in a plethora of signal transduction pathways in all eukaryotic models. They are not only precursors of second messengers but also directly interact with many protein effectors, thus regulating their localisation and/or activity. Furthermore, the discovery of independent PI(4,5)P2 signalling functions in the nucleus of mammalian cells have open a new perspective in the field. Striking similarities between mammalian, yeast and higher plant phosphoinositide signalling are noticeable, revealing early appearance and evolutionary conservation of this intracellular language. However, major differences have also been highlighted over the years, suggesting that organisms may have evolved different PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 functions over the course of eukaryotic diversification. Comparative studies of the different eukaryotic models is thus crucial for a comprehensive view of this fascinating signalling system. The present review aims to emphasize convergences and divergences between eukaryotic kingdoms in the mechanisms underlying PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 roles in signal transduction, in response to extracellular stimuli.© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Most lipid components of cell membranes are either neutral, like cholesterol, or zwitterionic, like phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. Very few lipids, such as sphingosine, are cationic at physiological pH. These generally interact only transiently with the lipid bilayer, and their synthetic analogs are often designed to destabilize the membrane for drug or DNA delivery. However, anionic lipids are common in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell membranes. The net charge per anionic phospholipid ranges from −1 for the most abundant anionic lipids such has phosphatidylserine, to near −7 for phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate, although the effective charge depends on many environmental factors. Anionic phospholipids and other negatively charged lipids such as lipopolysaccharides are not randomly distributed in the lipid bilayer, but are highly restricted to specific leaflets of the bilayer and to regions near transmembrane proteins or other organized structures within the plane of the membrane. This review highlights some recent evidence that counterions, in the form of monovalent or divalent metal ions, polyamines, or cationic protein domains, have a large influence of the lateral distribution of anionic lipids within the membrane, and that lateral demixing of anionic lipids has effects on membrane curvature and protein function that are important for biological control.},

The spatial heterogeneity of membrane lipids has been extensively explored in the context of cholesterol and phospholipid acyl-chain-dependent domain formation, but the effects of lipid head groups and soluble factors in lateral lipid organization are less clear. In this contribution, the effects of divalent calcium ions on domain formation in monolayers containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a polyanionic, multifunctional lipid of the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma bilayer, are reported. In binary monolayers of PIP2 mixed with zwitterionic lipids, calcium induced a rapid, PIP2-dependent surface pressure drop, with the concomitant formation of laterally segregated, PIP2-rich domains. The effect was dependent upon head-group multivalency, because lowered pH suppressed the surface-pressure effect and domain formation. In accordance with previous observations, inclusion of cholesterol in lipid mixtures induced coexistence of two liquid phases. Phase separation strongly segregated PIP2 to the cholesterol-poor phase, suggesting a role for cholesterol-dependent lipid demixing in regulating PIP2 localization and local concentration. Similar to binary mixtures, subphase calcium induced contraction of ternary cholesterol-containing monolayers; however, in these mixtures, calcium induced an unexpected, PIP2- and multivalency-dependent decrease in the miscibility phase transition surface pressure, resulting in rapid dissolution of the domains. This result emphasizes the likely critical role of subphase factors and lipid head-group specificity in the formation and stability of cholesterol-dependent domains in cellular plasma membranes.},

	abstract = {Phosphatidic acid (PA) is emerging as a key phospholipid in a wide range of biological processes such as signal transduction, secretion, or membrane fusion. In most cases, the biological functionality of PA is associated with the presence of micromolar to millimolar calcium concentrations. It has been argued that PA can create defects in the packing of lipids in membranes due to lateral phase separation by divalent ions, which in turn aggregate proteins with high affinity for PA. In this article, we present a detailed investigation of the properties of PA domains in the presence of divalent ions by a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical methods. Our results show that PA is extremely effective in binding divalent ions through its oxygen atoms, with a broad distribution of binding constants and exhibiting the phenomenon of charge inversion (a total number of bound counterion charges that exceeds the negative PA charge). We predict that a PA-rich domain undergoes a drastic reorganization when divalent cations reach micromolar concentrations (i.e., typical physiological conditions), as PA lipids become doubly charged by releasing their protons. We also present a detailed investigation of the properties of interfacial water, which determine the binding of proteins or other molecules. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results in the context of recent experimental studies in model systems and in real cells.},

	abstract = {Summary
Phospholipid-binding modules such as PH, C1, and C2 domains play crucial roles in location-dependent regulation of many protein kinases. Here, we identify the KA1 domain (kinase associated-1 domain), found at the C terminus of yeast septin-associated kinases (Kcc4p, Gin4p, and Hsl1p) and human MARK/PAR1 kinases, as a membrane association domain that binds acidic phospholipids. Membrane localization of isolated KA1 domains depends on phosphatidylserine. Using X-ray crystallography, we identified a structurally conserved binding site for anionic phospholipids in KA1 domains from Kcc4p and MARK1. Mutating this site impairs membrane association of both KA1 domains and intact proteins and reveals the importance of phosphatidylserine for bud neck localization of yeast Kcc4p. Our data suggest that KA1 domains contribute to “coincidence detection,” allowing kinases to bind other regulators (such as septins) only at the membrane surface. These findings have important implications for understanding MARK/PAR1 kinases, which are implicated in Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and autism.

budding into vesicles with the aid of a protein coat. Formation of
invaginated pits on the plasma membrane and subsequent budding of vesicles
is an energetically demanding process that involves the cooperation of
clathrin with many different proteins. Here we investigate the role of the
brain-enriched protein epsin 1 in this process. Epsin is targeted to areas
of endocytosis by binding the membrane lipid
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)). We show here that
epsin 1 directly modifies membrane curvature on binding to PtdIns(4,5)P(2)
in conjunction with clathrin polymerization. We have discovered that
formation of an amphipathic alpha-helix in epsin is coupled to
PtdIns(4,5)P(2) binding. Mutation of residues on the hydrophobic region of
this helix abolishes the ability to curve membranes. We propose that this
helix is inserted into one leaflet of the lipid bilayer, inducing
curvature. On lipid monolayers epsin alone is sufficient to facilitate the
formation of clathrin-coated invaginations.},

Most inquiries have focused on steric determinants of membrane organization, such as headgroup size and acyl-chain saturation. This manuscript reports a combination of theory and experiment that shows significant electrostatic contributions to surface pressures in monolayers of phospholipids where the charge spacing is smaller than the Bjerrum length. For molecules with steric cross sections typical of phospholipids in the cell membrane (approximately 50 A(2)), only polyphosphoinositides achieve this threshold. The most abundant such lipid is phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, which has between three and four charged groups at physiological conditions. Theory and experiment show that surface pressure increases linearly with phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate net charge and reveal crossing of high and low ionic strength pressure-area isotherms, due to opposing effects of ionic strength in compressed and expanded monolayers. Theory and experiment show that electrostatic effects are negligible for monolayers of univalent lipids, emphasizing the unique importance of electrostatic effects for lateral organization of polyphosphoinositides. Quantitative differences between theory and experiment suggest that attractive interactions between polyphosphoinositides, possibly mediated by hydrogen bonding, can lessen the effect of electrostatic repulsions.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11091368},
	abstract = {The miniaturization of components used in the construction of working
devices is being pursued currently by the large-downward (top-down)
fabrication. This approach, however, which obliges solid-state physicists
and electronic engineers to manipulate progressively smaller and smaller
pieces of matter, has its intrinsic limitations. An alternative approach
is a small-upward (bottom-up) one, starting from the smallest compositions
of matter that have distinct shapes and unique properties-namely
molecules. In the context of this particular challenge, chemists have been
extending the concept of a macroscopic machine to the molecular level. A
molecular-level machine can be defined as an assembly of a distinct number
of molecular components that are designed to perform machinelike movements
(output) as a result of an appropriate external stimulation (input). In
common with their macroscopic counterparts, a molecular machine is
characterized by 1) the kind of energy input supplied to make it work, 2)
the nature of the movements of its component parts, 3) the way in which
its operation can be monitored and controlled, 4) the ability to make it
repeat its operation in a cyclic fashion, 5) the timescale needed to
complete a full cycle of movements, and 6) the purpose of its operation.
Undoubtedly, the best energy inputs to make molecular machines work are
photons or electrons. Indeed, with appropriately chosen photochemically
and electrochemically driven reactions, it is possible to design and
synthesize molecular machines that do work. Moreover, the dramatic
increase in our fundamental understanding of self-assembly and
self-organizational processes in chemical synthesis has aided and abetted
the construction of artificial molecular machines through the development
of new methods of noncovalent synthesis and the emergence of
supramolecular assistance to covalent synthesis as a uniquely powerful
synthetic tool. The aim of this review is to present a unified view of the
field of molecular machines by focusing on past achievements, present
limitations, and future perspectives. After analyzing a few important
examples of natural molecular machines, the most significant developments
in the field of artificial molecular machines are highlighted. The systems
reviewed include 1) chemical rotors, 2) photochemically and
electrochemically induced molecular (conformational) rearrangements, and
3) chemically, photochemically, and electrochemically controllable
(co-conformational) motions in interlocked molecules (catenanes and
rotaxanes), as well as in coordination and supramolecular complexes,
including pseudorotaxanes. Artificial molecular machines based on
biomolecules and interfacing artificial molecular machines with surfaces
and solid supports are amongst some of the cutting-edge topics featured in
this review. The extension of the concept of a machine to the molecular
level is of interest not only for the sake of basic research, but also for
the growth of nanoscience and the subsequent development of
nanotechnology.},

are well described by a diffusion process on a two-dimensional potential
energy surface, where one dimension is a chemical reaction coordinate and
the other is the spatial displacement of the motor. The coupling between
chemistry and motion results from the shape of the surface, and motor
velocities and forces result from diffusion currents on this surface. This
microscopic description is shown to possess an equivalent kinetic
mechanism in which the rate constants depend on externally applied forces.
By using this equivalence we explore the characteristic properties of
several broad classes of motor mechanisms and give general expressions for
motor velocity versus load force for any member of each class. We show
that in some cases simple plots of 1/velocity vs. 1/concentration can
distinguish between classes of motor mechanisms and may be used to
determine the step at which movement occurs.},

to determine enthalpies from enzyme-catalysed reactions and can therefore
provide important insight into their reaction mechanisms. The ensemble
averages involved in traditional bulk calorimetry cannot probe the
transient effects that the energy exchanged in a reaction may have on the
catalyst. Here we obtain single-molecule fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy data and analyse them within the framework of a stochastic
theory to demonstrate a mechanistic link between the enhanced diffusion of
a single enzyme molecule and the heat released in the reaction. We propose
that the heat released during catalysis generates an asymmetric pressure
wave that results in a differential stress at the protein-solvent
interface that transiently displaces the centre-of-mass of the enzyme
(chemoacoustic effect). This novel perspective on how enzymes respond to
the energy released during catalysis suggests a possible effect of the

transbilayer colocalization between the SM-rich domains in the outer

recruitment of the small GTPase RhoA to the cleavage furrow, leading to
abnormal cytokinesis. These results suggest that the formation of SM-rich

	abstract = {Previous studies from this laboratory have established that addition of
acetylcholine (ACh) or norepinephrine to 32P-labeled rabbit iris smooth
muscle increases significantly the breakdown of triphosphoinositide (TPI)
and that these stimulatory effects are blocked by atropine and
phentolamine, respectively. The present studies were undertaken in order
to show the effect of Ca++ on the ACh-stimulated breakdown of TPI ("TPI
effect") in this tissue. Paired iris smooth muscles were prelabeled with
32Pi for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C in Ca++-free iso-osmotic salt medium.
The prelabeled irises were then washed and incubated for 10 minutes in
nonradioactive Ca++-free medium which contained 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose under
various conditions. The phospholipids were isolated by means of
two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and their radioactivities were
determined. In the absence of Ca++, 50 micrometer ACh increased TPI
breakdown and phosphatidic acid (PA) labeling by 16 and 38\%, respectively.
In the absence of ACh, 0.75 micrometer Ca++ increased TPI breakdown and PA
labeling by 11 and 20\%, respectively. When both ACh and Ca++ were added,
the increase in TPI breakdown and PA labeling rose to 32 and 74\%,
respectively. The labeling of phosphatidylinositol was found to be
insensitive to the presence of Ca++. Ca++ was determined in the iris
smooth muscle and it was found to contain 3.13 mumol of Ca++ per g of
tissue. This was reduced by 80\% after the muscle was washed and incubated
in a medium which contained 0.25 micrometer ethyleneglycol bis
(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). The TPI effect was
abolished by 0.25 micrometer EGTA and restored when excess Ca++ (1.25
micrometer) was added. Concentrations of Ca++ as low as 50 micrometer
provoked a TPI effect. Sr++ (2 micrometer), but not Ba++ or Mn++, was
found to substitute partially for Ca++. Ionophore A-23187 (20 micrometer)
was found to increase the breakdown of TPI and labeling of PA by 11 and
24\%, respectively. High concentrations of Ca++ (20 mM) exerted similar
effects. The increase in TPI breakdown and PA labeling in response to
these agents, in contrast to the TPI effect in response to ACh, was not
blocked by atropine. This suggests that the observed effects are not
caused by the release of endogenous ACh from the muscle. A possible
interpretation for the above observations on the role of Ca++ in the TPI
effect at the postsynaptic membrane of the iris smooth muscle could be:

(phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate) is generated by the lipid
kinase PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase) in the inner leaflet of the plasma
membrane, where it regulates a broad array of cell processes by recruiting
multiple signaling proteins containing PIP(3)-specific pleckstrin homology
(PH) domains to the membrane surface. Despite the broad importance of
PIP(3)-specific PH domains, the membrane docking geometry of a PH domain
bound to its target PIP(3) lipid on a bilayer surface has not yet been
experimentally determined. The present study employs EPR site-directed
spin labeling and relaxation methods to elucidate the membrane docking
geometry of GRP1 PH domain bound to bilayer-embedded PIP(3). The model
target bilayer contains the neutral background lipid PC and both essential
targeting lipids: (i) PIP(3) target lipid that provides specificity and
affinity, and (ii) PS facilitator lipid that enhances the PIP(3) on-rate
via an electrostatic search mechanism. The EPR approach measures membrane
depth parameters for 18 function-retaining spin labels coupled to the PH
domain, and for calibration spin labels coupled to phospholipids. The
resulting depth parameters, together with the known high resolution
structure of the co-complex between GRP1 PH domain and the PIP(3)
headgroup, provide sufficient constraints to define an optimized,
self-consistent membrane docking geometry. In this optimized geometry the
PH domain engulfs the PIP(3) headgroup with minimal bilayer penetration,
yielding the shallowest membrane position yet described for a lipid
binding domain. This binding interaction displaces the PIP(3) headgroup
from its lowest energy position and orientation in the bilayer, but the
headgroup remains within its energetically accessible depth and angular
ranges. Finally, the optimized docking geometry explains previous
biophysical findings including mutations observed to disrupt membrane
binding, and the rapid lateral diffusion observed for PIP(3)-bound GRP1 PH
domain on supported lipid bilayers.},

investigated which structural elements of phosphoinositides are

phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI(4)P)

acyl chains in CHO and HEK cells. We show that phosphate number and acyl
chain length determine cellular location and translocation movement. In
CHO cells, PI(4,5)P2 with a long acyl chain was released into the cytosol
easily because of a low partition coefficient whereas long chain PI was
released more slowly because of a high partition coefficient. In HEK
cells, the cellular location and translocation movement of PI were similar
to those of PI in CHO cells, whereas those of PI(4,5)P2 were different;
some mechanism restricted the translocation movement of PI(4,5)P2, and
this is in good agreement with the extremely low lateral diffusion of
PI(4,5)P2. In contrast to the dependence on the number of phosphates of
the phospholipid head group of long acyl chain analogs, short acyl chain
phospholipids easily undergo translocation movement regardless of cell
type and number of phosphates in the lipid headgroup.},

K+ (GIRK) channels are inhibited by Gq protein-coupled receptors (GqPCRs)
via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) depletion in a
receptor-specific manner. To investigate the mechanism of receptor
specificity, we examined whether the activation of GqPCRs induces
localized PIP2 depletion. When we applied endothelin-1 to the bath, GIRK
channel activities recorded in cell-attached patches were not changed,
implying that PIP2 signal is not diffusible but is a localized signal. To
test this possibility, we directly measured lateral diffusion by
introducing fluorescence-labeled phosphoinositides to a small area of the
membrane with patch pipettes. After pipettes were attached,
phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate or phosphatidylinositol diffused
rapidly to the entire membrane, whereas PIP2 was confined to the membrane
patch inside the pipette. The confinement of PIP2 was disrupted after
cytochalasin D treatment, suggesting that the cytoskeleton is responsible
for the low mobility of PIP2. The diffusion coefficient (D) of PIP2 in the
plasma membrane measured with the fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching technique was 0.00039 microm2/s (n = 6), which is markedly
lower than D of phosphatidylinositol (5.8 microm2/s, n = 5). Simulation of
PIP2 concentration profiles by the diffusion model confirms that when D is
small, the kinetics of PIP2 depletion at different distances from
phospholipase C becomes similar to the characteristic kinetics of GIRK
inhibition by different agonists. These results imply that PIP2 depletion
is localized adjacent to GqPCRs because of its low mobility, and that
spatial proximity of GqPCR and the target protein underlies the receptor
specificity of PIP2-mediated signaling.},

monovalent cations adsorb with a cation/phospholipid stoichiometry of 1:1

Previously the 1:1 and 1:2 binding of divalent cations were assumed to
occur by independent, parallel pathways. Here a serial adsorption scheme
is considered in which 1:2 binding occurs via reaction of 1:1-bound
complexes with adjacent unoccupied phospholipids. This two-dimensional
lattice reaction is shown to obey a law of mass action, and the
mass-action equilibrium constant is used to parameterize the adsorption

Delbrück predicts a weak, logarithmic dependence of the diffusion

its validity has never been thoroughly investigated. To check this model,
we measured the diffusion coefficients of various peptides and
transmembrane proteins, incorporated into giant unilamellar vesicles of
1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC) or in model
bilayers of tunable thickness. We show in this work that, for several
integral proteins spanning a large range of sizes, the diffusion
coefficient is strongly linked to the protein dimensions. A heuristic
model results in a Stokes-like expression for D, (D proportional, variant
1/R), which fits literature data as well as ours. Diffusion measurement is
then a fast and fruitful method; it allows determining the oligomerization
degree of proteins or studying lipid-protein and protein-protein

a hexagonal phase, which is not observed in pure DOPC. These results
indicate that the role of PIP(2) in membrane fusion could be, in part, due

molecular players involved in this fusion process have been identified, a
precise molecular description of their roles in the process is still
lacking. A case in point is the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ). Although PIP 2 is known to be essential for
vesicle fusion, its precise role in the process remains unclear. We have
re-investigated the role of this lipid in membrane structure and function
using the complementary experimental techniques of x-ray reflectivity,
both on lipid monolayers at an air–water interface and bilayers on a solid
support, and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction on lipid monolayers.
These techniques provide unprecedented access to structural information at
the molecular level, and detail the profound structural changes that occur
in a membrane following PIP 2 incorporation. Further, we also confirm and
extend previous findings that the association of SVs with membranes is
enhanced by PIP 2 incorporation, and reveal the structural changes that
underpin this phenomenon. Further, the association is further intensified
by a physiologically relevant amount of Ca 2+ ions in the subphase of the
monolayer, as revealed by the increase in interfacial pressure seen with
the lipid monolayer system. Finally, a theoretical calculation concerning
the products arising from the fusion of these SVs with proteoliposomes is

alanine-rich C kinase substrate) and integral (e.g., the epidermal growth
factor receptor) membrane proteins contain clusters of basic residues that
interact with acidic lipids in the plasma membrane. Previous measurements
demonstrate that the polyvalent acidic lipid phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate is bound electrostatically (i.e., sequestered) by
membrane-adsorbed basic peptides corresponding to these clusters. We
report here three experimental observations that suggest monovalent acidic
lipids are not sequestered by membrane-bound basic peptides. 1), Binding
of basic peptides to vesicles does not decrease when the temperature is
lowered below the fluid-to-gel phase transition. 2), The binding energy of
Lys-13 to lipid vesicles increases linearly with the fraction of
monovalent acidic lipids. 3), Binding of basic peptides to vesicles
produces no self-quenching of fluorescent monovalent acidic lipids. One
potential explanation for these results is that membrane-bound basic
peptides diffuse too rapidly for the monovalent lipids to be sequestered.
Indeed, our fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements show basic
peptides bound to phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine membranes have a
diffusion coefficient approximately twofold higher than that of lipids,
and those bound to phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate membranes have a diffusion coefficient comparable to that

(PIP(2)), several investigators have proposed that there are separate
pools of PIP(2) in the plasma membrane. Recent experiments show the
surface concentration of PIP(2) is indeed enhanced in regions where
phagocytosis, exocytosis, and cell division occurs. Kinases that produce
PIP(2) are also concentrated in these regions. However, how is the PIP(2)
produced by these kinases prevented from diffusing rapidly away? First,
proteins could act as "fences" around the perimeter of these regions.
Second, some factor could markedly decrease the diffusion coefficient, D,
of PIP(2) within these regions. We used fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
to investigate these two possibilities in the forming phagosomes of
macrophages injected with fluorescent PIP(2). FCS measurements show that
PIP(2) diffuses rapidly (D {\textasciitilde} 1 μm(2)/s) in both the forming phagosomes and
unengaged plasma membrane. FRAP measurements show that the fluorescence
from PIP(2) does not recover ({\textgreater}100 s) after photobleaching the entire
forming phagosome but recovers rapidly ({\textasciitilde}10 s) in a comparable area of
membrane outside the cup. These results (and similar data for a plasma

be consistent with the CHARMM all-atom biomolecular force fields, and the

hierarchical manner and reproduces the gas-phase and condensed-phase
properties of small-molecule model compounds corresponding to fragments of
pyranose monosaccharides. The resultant parameters are transferred to the
full pyranose monosaccharides, and additional parameter development is
done to achieve a complete hexopyranose monosaccharide force field.
Parametrization target data include vibrational frequencies, crystal
geometries, solute-water interaction energies, molecular volumes, heats of
vaporization, and conformational energies, including those for over 1800
monosaccharide conformations at the MP2/cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-31G(d) level of

aqueous solvation for the model compounds compare favorably with
experimental values. Also well-reproduced are monosaccharide crystal unit
cell dimensions and ring pucker, densities of concentrated aqueous glucose
systems, and the thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the exocyclic
torsion in dilute aqueous systems. The new parameter set expands the
CHARMM additive force field to allow for simulation of heterogeneous
systems that include hexopyranose monosaccharides in addition to proteins,

	abstract = {The regulation of ion channel activity by specific lipid molecules is
widely recognized as an integral component of electrical signalling in
cells. In particular, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), a
minor yet dynamic phospholipid component of cell membranes, is known to
regulate many different ion channels. PIP(2) is the primary agonist for
classical inward rectifier (Kir2) channels, through which this lipid can
regulate a cell's resting membrane potential. However, the molecular
mechanism by which PIP(2) exerts its action is unknown. Here we present
the X-ray crystal structure of a Kir2.2 channel in complex with a
short-chain (dioctanoyl) derivative of PIP(2). We found that PIP(2) binds
at an interface between the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the cytoplasmic
domain (CTD). The PIP(2)-binding site consists of a conserved non-specific
phospholipid-binding region in the TMD and a specific
phosphatidylinositol-binding region in the CTD. On PIP(2) binding, a
flexible expansion linker contracts to a compact helical structure, the
CTD translates 6 Å and becomes tethered to the TMD and the inner helix
gate begins to open. In contrast, the small anionic lipid dioctanoyl
glycerol pyrophosphatidic acid (PPA) also binds to the non-specific TMD
region, but not to the specific phosphatidylinositol region, and thus
fails to engage the CTD or open the channel. Our results show how PIP(2)
can control the resting membrane potential through a specific
ion-channel-receptor-ligand interaction that brings about a large
conformational change, analogous to neurotransmitter activation of ion
channels at synapses.},

phospholipid headgroup-binding specificity. To better understand the

construct (which includes three IQ domains and bound calmodulins) to large
unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of phosphatidylcholine and various
concentrations of phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylinositol

LUVs containing {\textgreater}60\% PS but very weakly to LUVs containing physiological
PS concentrations ({\textless}40\%). The myo1c tail and not the IQ motifs bind
tightly to LUVs containing 2\% PIP(2). Additionally, we found that the
myo1c tail binds to soluble inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate with nearly the

	abstract = {Gelsolin is an actin-severing protein whose action is initiated by Ca(2+)
and inhibited by binding to phosphorylated inositol lipid or
phosphoinositides. The regions of gelsolin responsible for
phosphoinositide binding are comprised of residues 150-169 (G150-169) and
135-142 (G135-142). The corresponding peptides possess similar binding
potency as native gelsolin. Their common feature is the presence of
arginine and lysine residues that can bind to negatively charged phosphate
groups of phosphoinositides. In this work the binding of the G150-169
peptide to a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) cluster in a
lipid membrane model was investigated by molecular dynamics calculations
(MD) with the AMBER 4.1 force field, taking into account explicit solvent
molecules. Initially the structure of G150-169 was simulated by using the
electrostatically driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) and MD methods, and the
resulting structure agreed within 3.7 A backbone-atom root mean square
deviation with the corresponding experimentally derived structure (PDB
code: 1SOL). Using this model for the peptide, a subsequent MD simulation
of G150-169 in a periodic box containing a model of
dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) lipids with a cluster of four PIP2
molecules was carried out. During the simulation G150-169 interacted
strongly with PIP2 molecules, initially by formation of salt bridges
between its N-terminal basic groups and the phosphate groups of PIP2,
followed by formation of hydrophobic bonds between the hydrophobic side
chains of the peptide and the fatty acid tail of the lipid. As a result of
the formation of hydrophobic bonds, the PIP2 molecules were pulled out
from the lipid bilayer. This mode of binding differs from those of other
PIP2-binding protein motifs such as PH domains that interact solely with
the hydrophilic head group of PIP2. These results suggest that
dissociation of gelsolin from actin by PIP2 lipids may involve entering of
the PIP2 molecules to the gelsolin-actin interface, thereby weakening the
interactions between these proteins.},

Diffraction measurements at high instrumental resolution provide a measure
of these fluctuations. In addition to providing better structural
determination, this opens a new window on interactions between bilayers,
so the experimental determination of interbilayer interaction parameters
is reviewed briefly. We introduce a new structural correction based on
fluctuations that has not been included in any previous studies. Updated
measurements, such as for the area compressibility modulus, are used to
provide adjustments to many of the literature values of structural
quantities. Since the gel (L(beta)') phase is valuable as a stepping stone

outer edge of the inositol ring is located at about 5.2A from the

	abstract = {We have previously suggested the involvement of a
Ca(2+)-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) complex in the
phospholipid transmembrane redistribution triggered by cytosolic Ca2+ in
erythrocytes. Indeed, the lipid scrambling was induced by extracellular
Ca2+ in erythrocytes loaded with PIP2 and was abolished in inside-out
vesicles prepared from PIP2-depleted erythrocytes (Sulpice, J.C.,
Zachowski, A., Devaux, P.F., \& Giraud, F. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269,
6347-6354). Here, we show that Ca2+ triggers a partial redistribution of
spin-labeled phospholipids in protein-free large unilamellar vesicles
(LUVs), only when they contain PIP2. Spermine, a polyamine known to
interact with PIP2 and reported to inhibit lipid scrambling in resealed
ghosts, was found to inhibit also the Ca(2+)-induced scrambling in LUVs
and in PIP2-loaded erythrocytes, presumably by interacting with PIP2 and
preventing the formation of Ca(2+)-PIP2 complexes. A similar mechanism can
account for spermine inhibition in natural membranes, confirming the role
of PIP2 in the scrambling process without excluding the participation of
proteins. In erythrocytes, activation of the phosphoinositide
phospholipase C (PLC) or a 20 h ATP depletion, which both led to a
reduction in the PIP2 content by 40-60\%, did not affect Ca(2+)-induced
phospholipid scrambling. In contrast, longer ATP depletion, resulting in a
80\% reduction in the PIP2 content, did induce a significant decrease in
lipid scrambling, suggesting that only the PIP2 pool resistant to the PLC
was involved. Spermine was able to inhibit hydrolysis of this pool by an

investigated by microcalorimetry in comparison with the effects of Ca2+
ions on the properties of glycerylphosphoryl-inositoldiphosphate (GPIDP)
and phosphatidylserine (PS). The mixing enthalpy per mole of the aqueous
dispersion of TPI with the CaCl2 solution was always positive in the whole
range of CaCl2 concentration, while those of GPIDP and PS were negative. A
model to explain this unusual result is presented. The hydrocarbon chains
of TPI molecules contribute positively to the mixing enthalpy, while those
of PS make a negative contribution. The positive contribution of the
hydrocarbon chains of TPI to the mixing enthalpy is attributed to the
dehydration enthalpy of the hydrophobic hydration induced by Ca2+ ions. In
the absence of Ca2+ ions, some spaces are likely to be produced between
their hydrocarbon chains because of strong electrostatic repulsion between
the large negative charges of the head groups of TPI and also because of
the loose packing due to the highly unsaturated chain of the arachidonic
acid of TPI. Then, the hydrophobic hydration in the interior of the TPI
membrane would be made possible. The influence of pH on the mixing
enthalpy of the aqueous dispersion of TPI with the CaCl2 solution also
agrees perfectly with this model.},

hamster kidney and Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts. First,
nitrobenzoxadiazole-labeled C6-phosphatidylcholine and C16-PIP(2) were
incorporated into plasma membrane "lawns" ( approximately 20 x 30 microm)
from these cells and into the outer monolayer of intact cells. Diffusion
coefficients determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching were
similar for the two lipids and were higher in lawns, approximately 0.3
microm(2)/s, than on the cell surface, approximately 0.1 microm(2)/s. For
membrane lawns, the fractional recoveries (75-90\%) were close to those
expected from the fraction of total membrane bleached, and labeling by the
probes was several times greater than for intact cells. Second, we
analyzed cells expressing M1 muscarinic receptors and green fluorescent
protein fused with PIP(2)-binding pleckstrin-homology domains, Tubby
domains or diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding C1 domains. On-cell gigaseal
patches were formed with pipette tips {\textgreater}5 microm in diameter. When the
agonist carbachol (0.3 mM: ) was applied either within or outside of the
pipette, lipid signals crossed the pipette barrier rapidly in both
directions and membrane blebbing occurred on both membrane sides. Accurate
simulations of lipid gradients required diffusion coefficients {\textgreater}1
microm(2)/s. Exogenous DAG also crossed the pipette barrier rapidly. In
summary, we found no evidence for restricted diffusion of signaling lipids
in these cells. The lower mobility and incorporation of phospholipid at
the extracellular leaflet may reflect a more ordered and condensed
extracellular monolayer, as expected from previous studies.},

temperature-sensitive paralysis and reduced neurotransmitter release, a

infection in vitro and in vivo by blocking viral attachment to epithelial

In vivo, the turnover of POPG in mice is relatively rapid, making
postinfection application impractical. Intranasal administration of POPG
(0.8-3.0 mg), 45 min before RSV inoculation in mice reduced viral
infection by 1 log unit, suppressed inflammatory cell appearance in the

monolayers with different surface charge densities. Monolayers with the
largest charge density ({\textgreater}0.6 C.m(-2)) show an increase of the surface
potential for a series of alkali metal cations from Li(+) to Cs(+) by
200-250 mV. The increase is similar for different monolayers and suggests
that this effect is independent of the particular type of headgroup. The
magnitude of variation is comparable with model estimations of the
electrical double layer (EDL) potential implying that the deviation from
the GC model is drastic. Deviations from the GC model rapidly vanish with
decreasing monolayer charge density and become hardly observable below 0.3
C.m(-2). For monolayers with a high charge density on subphases containing
different sized counterions, preferential participation of the smallest
ions in the EDL should be favorable in terms of electrostatic free energy
because of packing density limitations. This effect was demonstrated for
behenyl sulfate (BS) monolayers (0.64 C.m(-2)) with the X-ray reflectivity
technique. For the Cs(+)-Li(+) system, the fraction of Cs(+) in the EDL is
50-60\% compared with only 10\% of Cs(+) in the subphase. Providing high
surface charge density, a small univalent Cs(+) is capable to compete even
with a bulky divalent Mg(2+). For equal concentrations of Cs(+) and Mg(2+)
in the subphase, the Cs(+)/Mg(2+) ratio in EDL of BS monolayer is 1.3 to
2.0 (in contrast to 0.04, predicted by the GC model). All experimental

magnitude and turn TRXF into a truly simple tool for elemental analysis
within the EDL. A few TRXF experiments appear sufficient to disprove the
model of simultaneous binding of alkali earth metal cations and inorganic
anions to negatively charged phospholipid monolayers as proposed in
literature. Direct experimental support was provided to the essential
feature of the EDL near highly charged interfaces: The main amount of
counterions is concentrated in the thin inner part of the EDL irrespective
of the electrolyte concentration in the bulk. A study of the counterion
competition for the participation in the EDL of highly negatively charged
behenylsulfate (BS) monolayers (resulting from packing density
limitations) revealed that univalent Cs+ is quite competitive with
divalent Ca2+ and Ba2+ (which contradicts the classical Gouy-Chapman
model). If the univalent/divalent ion ratio in bulk is 9:1, the
corresponding ratio in the EDL is ca. 1.5 for Cs+/Ca2+ and 0.5 for
Cs+/Ba2+, whereas the model predicts 0.14 only. Bearing in mind packing
density limitations, these values are consistent with a series of sizes
for hydrated ions: Cs+ {\textless} Ba2+ {\textless} Ca2+.},

Several cardiotoxic compounds act on lipid bilayers to change the

interaction of local anesthetics with lipid membranous systems which might
be related to their structure-selective cardiotoxicity. Amide local
anesthetics (10-300 microM) were reacted with unilamellar vesicles which
were prepared with different phospholipids and cholesterol of varying
lipid compositions. They were compared on the potencies to modify membrane
fluidity by measuring fluorescence polarization. Local anesthetics
interacted with liposomal membranes to increase the fluidity. Increasing
anionic phospholipids in membranes enhanced the membrane-fluidizing
effects of local anesthetics with the potency being
cardiolipin{\textgreater}phosphatidic acid{\textgreater}phosphatidylglycerol{\textgreater}phosphatidylserine.
Cardiolipin was most effective on bupivacaine, followed by ropivacaine.
Local anesthetics interacted differently with biomimetic membranes
consisting of 10mol\% cardiolipin, 50mol\% other phospholipids and 40mol\%
cholesterol with the potency being
bupivacaine{\textgreater}ropivacaine{\textgreater}lidocaine{\textgreater}prilocaine, which agreed with the rank

cardiolipin-containing membranes at cardiotoxicologically relevant
concentrations. Bupivacaine is considered to affect lipid bilayers by
interacting electrostatically with negatively charged cardiolipin head
groups and hydrophobically with phospholipid acyl chains. The
structure-dependent interaction with lipid membranes containing
cardiolipin, which is preferentially localized in cardiomyocyte

crucial role in nearly all signaling pathways involving cell membranes, in
part because of its variable electrical charge in response to
environmental conditions. To investigate how charge is regulated in
domains of PA, we applied surface-sensitive X-ray reflectivity and
fluorescence near-total-reflection techniques to determine the binding of
divalent ions (Ca(2+) at various pH values) to
1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DMPA) and to the simpler lipid
dihexadecyl phosphate (DHDP) spread as monolayers at the air/water

only by the pK(a) and local pH but also by the strong affinity to PA
driven by electrostatic correlations from divalent ions and the
cooperative effect of the two dissociable protons, which dramatically
enhance the surface charge. A precise theoretical model is presented
providing a general framework to predict the protonation state of PA.
Implications for recent experiments on charge regulation by hydrogen

Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy. The difference between
spectra recorded in the presence and absence of agonist from the nAChR
reconstituted into 3:1:1 egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC)/DOPA/Chol membranes
exhibits positive and negative bands that serve as markers of the
structural changes associated with the resting to desensitized
conformational change. These markers are absent in similar difference
spectra recorded from the nAChR reconstituted into EPC membranes lacking
both Chol and DOPA, indicating that the nAChR cannot undergo
conformational change in response to agonist binding. When low levels of
either Chol or DOPA up to 25 mol \% of the total lipid are included in the
EPC membranes, the markers suggest the predominant stabilization of a
conformation that is a structural intermediate between the resting and
desensitized states. At higher levels of either Chol or DOPA, the nAChR is
stabilized in a conformation that is capable of undergoing agonist-induced
desensitization, although DOPA appears to be required for the nAChR to
adopt a conformation fully equivalent to that found in native and 3:1:1
EPC/DOPA/Chol membranes. The ability of these two structurally diverse

functional state of the nAChR suggests that lipids act on the nAChR via an
indirect effect on some physical property of the lipid bilayer. The data
also suggest that anionic lipids are essential to stabilize a fully
functional nAChR. We propose that membrane fluidity modulates the relative
populations of nAChRs in the resting and desensitized states but that
subtle structural changes in the presence of anionic lipids are essential

the finding that Ca2+ and Mg2+ destabilized the erythrocyte membrane as
evidenced by decreasing the t1/2 for fragmentation. Extracellular
polyamines were not effective except under conditions that caused

the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family. The FERM (4.1 ezrin/radixin/moesin)
domain in their N-terminus contains a phosphatidylinositol 4,5
bisphosphate (PIP(2)) (membrane) binding site whereas their C-terminus
binds actin. In this work, our aim was to quantify the interaction of
ezrin with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing PIP(2). For this
purpose, we produced human recombinant ezrin bearing a cysteine residue at
its C-terminus for subsequent labeling with Alexa488 maleimide. The
functionality of labeled ezrin was checked by comparison with that of
wild-type ezrin. The affinity constant between ezrin and LUVs was
determined by cosedimentation assays and fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy. The affinity was found to be approximately 5 microM for
PIP(2)-LUVs and 20- to 70-fold lower for phosphatidylserine-LUVs. These
results demonstrate, as well, that the interaction between ezrin and
PIP(2)-LUVs is not cooperative. Finally, we found that ezrin FERM domain
(area of approximately 30 nm(2)) binding to a single PIP(2) can block
access to neighboring PIP(2) molecules and thus contributes to lower the
accessible PIP(2) concentration. In addition, no evidence exists for a
clustering of PIP(2) induced by ezrin addition.},

bacteria, respectively. Isolated LPS and LTA decrease the antimicrobial
activities of PBP 10, as well as other antimicrobial peptides, such as
cathelicidin-LL37 (LL37) and mellitin. In an effort to elucidate the
mechanism of bacterial killing by PBP 10, we compared its effects on
artificial lipid bilayers and eukaryotic cell membranes with the actions
of the mellitin, magainin II, and LL37 peptides. This study reveals that
pore formation is unlikely to be involved in PBP 10-mediated membrane
destabilization. We also investigated the effects of these peptides on
platelets and red blood cells (RBCs). Comparison of these antimicrobial
peptides shows that only mellitin has a toxic effect on platelets and RBCs
in a concentration range concomitant with its bactericidal activity. The
hemolytic activities of the PBP 10 and LL37 peptides significantly
increase when RBCs are osmotically swollen in hypotonic solution,
indicating that these antibacterial peptides may take advantage of the
more extended form of bacterial membranes in exerting their killing
activities. Additionally, we found that LL37 hemolytic activity was much
higher when RBCs were induced to expose phosphatidylserine to the external
leaflet of their plasma membranes. This finding suggests that asymmetrical
distribution of phospholipids in the external membranes of eukaryotic
cells may represent an important factor in determining the specificity of
antibacterial peptides for targeting bacteria rather than eukaryotic

extracellular face of the plasma membrane is associated with increased
procoagulant activity. PS externalization is generally attributed to an
increase in intracellular Ca(2+). Various phospholipid transporters, such
as specific scramblases or proteins from the family of multidrug
resistance proteins, and cofactors such as phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) have been proposed to participate in this process.
In this study, we used a membrane-permeant polycationic peptide
(RhB-QRLFQVKGRR), derived from the PIP2-binding site of gelsolin (GS
160-169) and linked to rhodamine B, to investigate the role of PIP2 in PS
externalization in whole platelets. The peptide penetrated rapidly into
the platelets, specifically bound to PIP2, and induced PS exposure to a
similar extent as thrombin or collagen, but independently of changes in
intracellular Ca(2+) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity. A pretreatment
of platelets with quercetin, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide metabolism,
drastically decreased PS exposure induced by agonists or peptide. In large
unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), the presence of PIP2 was strictly required
for the induction of scrambling of NBD-labeled phospholipids (PC and PS)
by the peptide. In inside-out vesicles from erythrocytes (IOVs), the
peptide also induced redistribution of PC and PS. Our data suggest that,
in intact platelets, PIP2 acts as a target of polycationic effectors,
including Ca(2+), to promote PS exposure. The use of a membrane-permeant

investigate the role of PIP2 in various cellular processes.},

Large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations were therefore employed to

their effect on membrane bending. A residue-residue and residue-lipid

the simulations. It was also found that the degree of membrane bending is
directly related to the orientation of the additional insert helix, and
that the perpendicular configuration generates the largest curvature
consistent with mutation experiments. In addition, the angle formed
between the two N-BAR monomers at the top of the arch is sensitive to the

distilled water at pH 7. The cooperativity of the thermal transition of
dimyristoylphosphatidic acid at pH 7.0, in contrast, was little affected
by the presence or absence of 0.5 M NaCl. The most dramatic changes in
phase transition properties were observed with phosphatidylglycerol. The
morphology of phosphatidylglycerol was also altered by NaCl. At high salt
concentrations, typical multilamellar structures were observed by
freeze-fracture electron microscopy. However, in distilled water the large
multilamellar structures are disrupted, with opened shells and smaller
particles of 20-30 nm diameter being observed, in addition to a few larger
vesicles. Structures of differing morphology could be partially separated
from aqueous 'solutions' of phosphatidylglycerol by ultracentrifugation.
The supernate contained only small particles. The results are discussed in
terms of the large effective head group volume resulting from strong
electrostatic repulsion at low ionic strengths. This allows the anionic
lipids, particularly phosphatidylglycerol, to form hydrophilic surfaces
with high curvature so as to seal the bilayer edges of discs or shells.
Thus, certain anionic lipids in distilled water destabilize bilayers by a
mechanism which is opposite to that found with lipids which destabilize
bilayers by forming the hexagonal phase.},

reversibly sequesters a significant fraction of the
L-alpha-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) on the plasma
membrane. To test this, we utilize three techniques that measure the
ability of a peptide corresponding to its effector domain,
MARCKS(151-175), to sequester PIP2 in model membranes containing
physiologically relevant fractions (15-30\%) of the monovalent acidic lipid
phosphatidylserine. First, we measure fluorescence resonance energy
transfer from Bodipy-TMR-PIP2 to Texas Red MARCKS(151-175) adsorbed to
large unilamellar vesicles. Second, we detect quenching of Bodipy-TMR-PIP2
in large unilamellar vesicles when unlabeled MARCKS(151-175) binds to
vesicles. Third, we identify line broadening in the electron paramagnetic
resonance spectra of spin-labeled PIP2 as unlabeled MARCKS(151-175)
adsorbs to vesicles. Theoretical calculations (applying the
Poisson-Boltzmann relation to atomic models of the peptide and bilayer)
and experimental results (fluorescence resonance energy transfer and
quenching at different salt concentrations) suggest that nonspecific
electrostatic interactions produce this sequestration. Finally, we show
that the PLC-delta1-catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2, but not binding of its
PH domain to PIP2, decreases markedly as MARCKS(151-175) sequesters most
of the PIP2.},

that this electrostatic/hydrogen bond switch turns the phosphate of PA

to the formation of phosphoinositide-enriched microdomains,
phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol monophosphate
(phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI-3P), -4-phosphate (PI-4P), or
-5-phosphate (PI-5P)) mixed vesicles were investigated by calorimetric
(DSC) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR), and fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements. The experiments furnished
results consistent with a pH-dependent formation of phosphatidylinositol
monophosphate-enriched microdomains. The domain formation was most
pronounced between pH approximately 7 and approximately 9.5, whereas
slightly acidic pH values (pH 4) resulted in the disintegration of the
domains. This pH-dependent phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol
monophosphate demixing was observed for the gel phase (FTIR experiments)
as well as for the fluid lipid phase (FRET measurements). The observed
microdomains are presumably stabilized by hydroxyl/hydroxyl as well as
hydroxyl/phosphomonoester and phosphodiester interactions. While the pH
dependence of the mutual phosphatidylinositol monophosphate interaction
was largely the same for all investigated phosphatidylinositol
monophosphates, it turned out that the relative stability of
phosphatidylinositol monophosphate-enriched microdomains (pH 7-9.5) was
governed by the position of the phosphomonoester group at the inositol
ring (PI-4P {\textgreater} PI-5P {\textgreater} PI-3P). Demixing was also observed for
phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol mixed vesicles; however, in this
case the microdomain formation was only slightly affected by pH changes.},

molecule located on the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. In order to
perform its various signaling functions, it is suggested that PIP2 must be
able to form localized clusters. In this study, we have used LAURDAN
generalized polarization function (GP) with unlabeled PIP2 and single
point fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and brightness analysis of
various BODIPY labeled PIP2 to determine the presence of clusters in the
membrane of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) made of
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) or a mixture of
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), sphingomyelin and
cholesterol. We determined the number of freely diffusing fluorescent
BODIPY molecules in the membrane and found that in GUVs containing various
amounts of labeled PIP2, this number was significantly lower than in GUVs
made with the control BODIPY labeled hexadecyl phosphatidylcholine
(BODIPY-HPC). Also, we noted an increase in brightness of the labeled PIP2
particles with increasing labeled PIP2 molar fraction. Together with the
observed change in LAURDAN GP with increasing molar fraction of unlabeled
PIP2, these results demonstrate the presence of PIP2 enriched clusters
that are smaller than the resolution limit of the fluorescent microscope.
In addition, we report the presence of a hypsochromic shift of the

inward rectifiers is strongly suppressed by the elevation of cellular
cholesterol. The goal of this study is to determine whether cholesterol
suppresses Kir channels directly. To achieve this goal, purified
prokaryotic Kir (KirBac1.1) channels were incorporated into liposomes of
defined lipid composition, and channel activity was assayed by (86)Rb(+)
uptake. Our results show that (86)Rb(+) flux through KirBac1.1 is strongly
inhibited by cholesterol. Incorporation of 5\% (mass
cholesterol/phospholipid) cholesterol into the liposome suppresses
(86)Rb(+) flux by {\textgreater}50\%, and activity is completely inhibited at 12-15\%.
However, epicholesterol, a stereoisomer of cholesterol with similar
physical properties, has significantly less effect on KirBac-mediated
(86)Rb(+) uptake than cholesterol. Furthermore, analysis of multiple
sterols suggests that cholesterol-induced inhibition of KirBac1.1 channels
is mediated by specific interactions rather than by changes in the
physical properties of the lipid bilayer. In contrast to the inhibition of
KirBac1.1 activity, cholesterol had no effect on the activity of
reconstituted KscA channels (at up to 250 microg/mg of phospholipid).
Taken together, these observations demonstrate that cholesterol suppresses
Kir channels in a pure protein-lipid environment and suggest that the
interaction is direct and specific.},

the calcium chelator EDTA to vesicle dispersions produced a decrease in

viscous fingering of domains and decreased domain size over hours.
Although the latter suggests that the charge of the polyanion contributes
to domain formation, the remixing of more negative chains at high pH is
surprising. Domain roughening at high pH is also accelerated by EDTA,
which highlights the dominance of cross-bridging. Importantly, even though
vesicles were perturbed only externally, the inner and outer leaflets
remain coupled throughout, consistent with molecular dynamics simulations

innate immune system of all species. AMPs are highly selective and can be

standard antibiotic therapies. Understanding the crucial parameters of
peptide-membrane interactions is necessary for elucidation of the
molecular mechanisms of action. Phospholipid monolayers, as simple 2D
models of the membrane surface, can be effectively used for studies of
peptide-membrane interactions. The present study is focused on the
recently discovered peptide arenicin-1 (Ar-1), which possesses
antibacterial and antifungal activities. A linear derivative with serine
residues instead of cysteines (C/S-Ar-1) was additionally used to
investigate the influence of the AMP on the phase behavior of lipid
monolayers at the air/liquid interface. Using the Langmuir balance
technique and IRRAS allows us to conclude that both original and modified
arenicins reveal a strong influence on the phase transition of anionic
phospholipids (fluidization of the lipid hydrocarbon chains), whereas the
thermodynamic properties of the zwitterionic phospholipid layers are not
affected. A strong effect of the modified peptide on the ordering of
negatively charged phospholipids at the air-water interface compared to
zwitterionic phospholipids has been observed using GIXD measurements,
supported by IRRAS simulations for the spectral range corresponding to the
lipid hydrocarbon chains. At lateral pressures above 30 mN/m, both
peptides are squeezed out from zwitterionic lipid monolayers, but remains
attached to and partly incorporated in anionic lipid monolayers. This

endocytic machinery is an important regulatory process required for many
essential cellular functions. The role of cooperative protein-protein and
protein-membrane interactions in the ubiquitous endocytic pathway in
mammalian cells, namely the clathrin-dependent endocytosis, remains
unresolved. We employ the Helfrich membrane Hamiltonian together with
surface evolution methodology to address how the shapes and energetics of
vesicular-bud formation in a planar membrane are stabilized by presence of
the clathrin-coat assembly. Our results identify a unique dual role for
the tubulating protein epsin: multiple epsins localized spatially and
orientationally collectively play the role of a curvature inducing capsid;
in addition, epsin serves the role of an adapter in binding the clathrin
coat to the membrane. Our results also suggest an important role for the
clathrin lattice, namely in the spatial- and orientational-templating of
epsins. We suggest that there exists a critical size of the coat above
which a vesicular bud with a constricted neck resembling a mature vesicle
is stabilized. Based on the observed strong dependence of the vesicle
diameter on the bending rigidity, we suggest that the variability in
bending stiffness due to variations in membrane composition with cell type
can explain the experimentally observed variability on the size of
clathrin-coated vesicles, which typically range 50-100 nm. Our model also
provides estimates for the number of epsins involved in stabilizing a
coated vesicle, and without any direct fitting reproduces the
experimentally observed shapes of vesicular intermediates as well as their
probability distributions quantitatively, in wildtype as well as CLAP IgG
injected neuronal cell experiments. We have presented a minimal mesoscale

the process of vesicle nucleation induced by the clathrin-coated assembly

Membrane lipid phase coexistence is expected to modulate these processes

tension at phase boundaries. In this contribution, we compare the
predictions from a shape theory derived for vesicles with fluid phase
coexistence to the geometry of giant unilamellar vesicles with coexisting
liquid-disordered (L(d)) and liquid-ordered (L(o)) phases. We find a
bending modulus for the L(o) phase higher than that of the L(d) phase and
a saddle-splay (Gauss) modulus difference with the Gauss modulus of the
L(o) phase being more negative than the L(d) phase. The Gauss modulus
critically influences membrane processes that change topology, such as
vesicle fission or fusion, and could therefore be of significant
biological relevance in heterogeneous membranes. Our observations of
experimental vesicle geometries being modulated by Gaussian curvature
moduli differences confirm the prediction by the theory of Juelicher and
Lipowsky.},

standard Gibbs free energy for the binding of these peptides is 3, 5, and
7 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding energies decrease as the mol\% of
acidic lipids in the membrane decreases and/or as the salt concentration
increases. Several lines of evidence suggest that these hydrophilic
peptides do not penetrate the polar headgroup region of the membrane and
that the binding is mainly due to electrostatic interactions. To calculate
the binding energies from classical electrostatics, we applied the
nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation to atomic models of the phospholipid
bilayers and the basic peptides in aqueous solution. The electrostatic
free energy of interaction, which arises from both a long-range coulombic
attraction between the positively charged peptide and the negatively
charged lipid bilayer, and a short-range Born or image charge repulsion,
is a minimum when approximately 2.5 A (i.e., one layer of water) exists
between the van der Waals surfaces of the peptide and the lipid bilayer.
The calculated molar association constants, K, agree well with the
measured values: K is typically about 10-fold smaller than the
experimental value (i.e., a difference of about 1.5 kcal/mol in the free
energy of binding). The predicted dependence of K (or the binding free
energies) on the ionic strength of the solution, the mol\% of acidic lipids
in the membrane, and the number of basic residues in the peptide agree
very well with the experimental measurements. These calculations are
relevant to the membrane binding of a number of important proteins that

first contribution is always positive and opposes domain formation,
whereas the second contribution may become negative and, at low ionic

Gouy-Chapman-Stern theory, makes four predictions: 1) multivalent basic
ligands, for which the membrane binding is a steep function of the mole

break up at high concentrations of either 2) basic ligand or 3) monovalent

embedded probe molecules were used to detect phase behavior of various
phospholipids. The techniques were directly compared for detecting the
transition of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and
dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (DPPA) dispersed in aqueous salt solutions.
Excellent agreement occurred in the case of phosphatidylcholine; however,
in the case of phosphatidic acid, at pH 6.5, transitions detected by
fluorescence polarization using the disc-like perylene molecule occurred
about 10 degrees lower than those detected by DSC. Discrepancy between
fluorescence and DSC methods is eliminated by using a rod-like molecule,
diphenylhexatriene (DPH). Both techniques show that doubly ionizing the
phosphate group reduces the Tc by about 9 degrees. Direct pH titration of
fluidity can be accomplished and this effect is most dramatic when
membranes are in their transition temperature range (ca. 50 degrees).
Phosphatidic acid transitions occur at higher temperatures, and have
appreciably lower transition enthalpies and entropies than
phosphatidylcholine. These effect could not be explained simply on the
basis of double layer electrostatics and several other factors were
discussed in an attempt to rationalize the results. Addition of monovalent
cations (0.01-0.5 M) is shown to increase the Tc of
dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol by less than 3 degrees. However, addition
of (1 x 10-3 M) Ca2+ abolishes the phase transition of both
phosphatidyglycerol and phosphatidylserine in the range 0-70 degrees.
Preliminary X-ray evidence indicates the phosphatidylserine-Ca2+ bilayers
are in a crystalline state at 24 degrees. In contrast, 5 x 10-3 M Mg2+
only broadens the transition and increases the Tc indicating a
considerable difference between the effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+.
Neutralization of PS increases the Tc from 6 degrees (at pH 7.4) to 20-26
degrees (at pH 2.5-3.0) but does not abolish the transition, suggesting
the Ca2+ effect involves more than charge neutralization. Addition of Ca2+
to mixed phosphatidylserine-phosphatidylcholine dispersions, induces a
phase separation of the dipalmitoyl- (and also distearoyl-)
phosphatidylcholine as seen by the appearance of a new endothermic peak at
41 degrees (58 degrees). Similarly, in mixed (dipalmitoyl) phosphatidic
acid-phosphatidylcholine (2:1) dispersions, Ca2+ again can separate the
phosphatidylcholine component.},

yet these molecules have a simple phosphate headgroup. To find out what is
so special about these lipids, we determined the ionization behavior of
phosphatidic acid (PA) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in extended (flat)
mixed lipid bilayers using magic angle spinning 31P NMR. Our data show two
surprising results. First, despite identical phosphomonoester headgroups,
LPA carries more negative charge than PA when present in a
phosphatidylcholine bilayer. Dehydroxy-LPA
[1-oleoyl-3-(phosphoryl)propanediol] behaves in a manner identical to that
of PA, indicating that the difference in negative charge between LPA and
PA is caused by the hydroxyl on the glycerol backbone of LPA and its
interaction with the phosphomonoester headgroup. Second, deprotonation of
phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid was found to be strongly
stimulated by the inclusion of phosphatidylethanolamine in the bilayer,
indicating that lipid headgroup charge depends on local lipid composition
and will vary between the different subcellular locations of (L)PA. Our
findings can be understood in terms of a hydrogen bond formed within the
phosphomonoester headgroup of (L)PA and its destabilization by competing
intra- or intermolecular hydrogen bonds. We propose that this hydrogen
bonding property of (L)PA is involved in the various cellular functions of
these lipids.},

fusion is the lipid stalk. Although many aspects of the stalk hypothesis
were elaborated theoretically and confirmed by experiments it remained
unresolved whether stalk formation is always an energy consuming process
or if there are conditions where the stalks are energetically favorable
and form spontaneously resulting in an equilibrium stalk phase. Motivated
by a recent breakthrough experiments we analyze the physical factors
determining the spontaneous stalk formation. We show that this process can
be driven by interplay between two factors: the elastic energy of lipid
monolayers including a contribution of the saddle splay deformation and
the energy of hydration repulsion acting between apposing membranes. We
analyze the dependence of stalk formation on the saddle splay (Gaussian)
modulus of the lipid monolayers and estimate the values of this modulus
based on the experimentally established phase boundary between the
lamellar and the stalk phases. We suggest that fusion proteins can induce
stalk formation just by bringing the membranes into close contact, and
accumulating, at least locally, a sufficiently large energy of the
hydration repulsion.},

the human proteome. They are best known for their ability to bind
phosphoinositides with high affinity and specificity, although it is now
clear that less than 10\% of all PH domains share this property. Cases in
which PH domains bind specific phosphoinositides with high affinity are
restricted to those phosphoinositides that have a pair of adjacent
phosphates in their inositol headgroup. Those that do not [PtdIns3P,
PtdIns5P and PtdIns(3,5)P2] are instead recognized by distinct classes of
domains including FYVE domains, PX (phox homology) domains, PHD (plant
homeodomain) fingers and the recently identified PROPPINs (b-propellers
that bind polyphosphoinositides). Of the 90\% of PH domains that do not
bind strongly and specifically to phosphoinositides, few are well
understood. One group of PH domains appears to bind both phosphoinositides
(with little specificity) and Arf (ADP-ribosylation factor) family small
G-proteins, and are targeted to the Golgi apparatus where both
phosphoinositides and the relevant Arfs are both present. Here, the PH
domains may function as coincidence detectors. A central challenge in
understanding the majority of PH domains is to establish whether the very
low affinity phosphoinositide binding reported in many cases has any
functional relevance. For PH domains from dynamin and from Dbl family
proteins, this weak binding does appear to be functionally important,
although its precise mechanistic role is unclear. In many other cases, it
is quite likely that alternative binding partners are more relevant, and
that the observed PH domain homology represents conservation of structural
fold rather than function.},

progression of endocytic events leading to vesicle scission. The central
idea is that membrane curvature is coupled to the accompanying biochemical
reactions. This coupling ensures that the process is robust and culminates
in an interfacial force that pinches off the vesicle. Calculated phase

predict unique testable endocytic phenotypes in yeast and mammalian cells.

affinity for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) cations, as revealed by electrokinetic and
stability experiments. However, despite this similar affinity,
experimental evidence shows that the presence of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) induces
very different aggregation behavior for PS(-) liposomes as characterized
by their fractal dimensions. Also, turbidity measurements confirm
substantial differences in aggregation behavior depending on the presence
of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) cations. These puzzling results suggest that although
these two cations have a similar affinity for PS(-) lipids, they induce
substantial structural differences in lipid bilayers containing each of
these cations. In other words, these cations have strong ion-specific
effects on the structure of PS(-) membranes. This interpretation is
supported by all-atomic molecular-dynamics simulations showing that Ca(2+)
and Mg(2+) cations have different binding sites and induce different
membrane hydration. We show that although both ions are incorporated deep
into the hydrophilic region of the membrane, they have different positions
and configurations at the membrane. Absorbed Ca(2+) cations present a peak
at a distance {\textasciitilde}2 nm from the center of the lipid bilayer, and their most
probable binding configuration involves two oxygen atoms from each of the
charged moieties of the PS molecule (phosphate and carboxyl groups). In
contrast, the distribution of absorbed Mg(2+) cations has two different
peaks, located a few angstroms before and after the Ca(2+) peak. The most
probable configurations (corresponding to these two peaks) involve binding
to two oxygen atoms from carboxyl groups (the most superficial binding
peak) or two oxygen atoms from phosphate groups (the most internal peak).
Moreover, simulations also show differences in the hydration structure of
the membrane: we obtained a hydration of 7.5 and 9 water molecules per
lipid in simulations with Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), respectively.},

components in vesicles prepared from acidic phospholipids has been
examined using freeze-fracture electron microscopy and differential
scanning calorimetry. Ca2+, and to a certain extent Mg2+, induce extensive
mixing of vesicle membrane components and drastic structural
rearrangements to form new membranous structures. In contrast to the
mixing of vesicle membrane components in the absence of Ca2+ described in
the accompanying paper which occurs via diffusion of lipid molecules
between vesicles, mixing of membrane components induced by Ca2+ or Mg2+
results from true fusion of entire vesicles. There appears to be a
"threshold" concentration at which Ca2+ and Mg2+ become effective in
inducing vesicle fusion and the threshold concentration varies for
different acidic phospholipid species. Different phospholipids also vary
markedly in their relative responsiveness to Ca2+ and Mg2+, with certain
phospholipids being much more susceptible to fusion by Ca2+ than Mg2+.
Vesicle fusion induced by divalent cations also requires that the lipids
of the interacting membranes be in a "fluid" state (T greater than Tc).
Fusion of vesicle membranes by Ca2+ and Mg2+ does not appear to be due to
simple electrostatic charge neutralization. Rather the action of these
cations in inducing fusion is related to their ability to induce
isothermal phase transitions and phase separations in phospholipid
membranes. It is suggested that under these conditions membranes become
transiently susceptible to fusion as a result of changes in molecular
packing and creation of new phase boundaries induced by Ca2+ (or Mg2+).},

effects of pH and mono- and divalent cations on the phase transition of
lecithin, cephalin, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid bilayers.
Phosphatidic acid with two ionizable protons was selected for a systematic
investigation. A change in pH from 7 to 9 increases the charge per polar
group from one to two elementary charges. This lowers the transition
temperature by about 20 degrees C in agreement with the theory. In this pH
region rather small changes in pH suffice to induce the phase transition
at constant temperature. Divalent cations (Mg(++) and Ca(++)) increase the
transition temperature by charge neutralization and thus can be used to
induce the fluid --{\textgreater} ordered transition at constant temperature. In
contrast, monovalent cations (Li(+), Na(+), K(+)) lower the transition
temperature, or fluidize the bilayer structure at a given temperature.
Rather small changes in ionic environment can induce gross alterations in
bilayer structure; divalent and monovalent cations have antagonistic
effects. This result parallels current theories on nerve excitation and

obtained by spreading POPC/PIP2 (92:8) small unilamellar vesicles onto
hydrophilic silicon substrates at a low pH of 4.8. These membranes were
capable of binding ezrin, resulting in large protein coverage as concluded
from reflectometric interference spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy.
As deduced from fluorescence microscopy, only under low pH conditions, a
homogeneously appearing distribution of fluorescently labeled PIP2
molecules in the membrane was achieved. Fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching experiments revealed that PIP2 is not mobile in the bottom
layer of the SLBs, while PIP2 is fully mobile in the top layer with
diffusion coefficients of about 3 μm(2)/s. This diffusion coefficient was
considerably reduced by a factor of about 3 if ezrin has been bound to
PIP2 in the membrane.},

	abstract = {The interaction of phosphatidylserine dispersions with "hydrophobic",
organic cations (acetylcholine, tetraethylammonium ion) is compared with
that of simple inorganic cations (Na+, Ca2+); differences in the hydration
properties of the two classes of ions exist in the bulk phase as evident
from spin-lattice relaxation time T1 measurements. It is shown that the
reaction products (cation-phospholipid) differ markedly in their
physicochemical behaviour. With increasing concentration both classes of
ions reduce the zota-potential of phosphatidylserine surfaces, the
monovalent inorganic cations being only slightly more effective than the
hydrophobic cations. Inorganic cations cause precipitation of the lipid
once the surface charge of the bilayer is reduced to a certain threshold
value. This is not the case with the organic cations. The difference is
probably associated with the different hydration properties of the
resulting complexes. Thus binding of Ca2+ causes displacement of water of
hydration and formation of an anhydrous, hydrophobic
calcium-phosphatidylserine complex which is insoluble in water, whereas
the product of binding of the organic cations is hydrated, hydrophilic and
water soluble. The above findings are consistent with NMR results which
show that the phosphodiester group is involved in the binding of both
classes of cations as well as being the site of the primary hydration
shell. Besides affecting interbilayer membrane interactions such as those
involved in cell adhesion and membrane fusion, the binding of both classes
of cation can affect the molecular packing within a bilayer.},

that a fraction of the protonated polyamine close to unity is strongly

extended to a case which includes the effects of binding of monovalent

thickness d which is permeable to electrolyte ions and in which the
membrane-fixed charged groups are distributed at a uniform density N. We
also assume that each charged group can bind one monovalent cation with an
equilibrium constant K. In the limit of d → 0, keeping the product Nd
constant, our model gives the most commonly used model in which ion
binding is considered to occur only at the membrane surface (of zero
thickness). It is shown that the amount of bound cations as well as the
potential distribution are found to depend strongly on d. For example, in
0.1 M 1-1 electrolyte with K = 0.8 M−1, the reduction in magnitude of the
surface potential at the outer surface of the surface charge layer of 10 Å
thickness is about 40 ∼ 60\% of that for the membrane having the surface
charge layer of zero thickness, and the deviation of the amount of bound
cations for the membrane of d = 10 Å from that predicted for d = 0 is
30–40\%, indicating that the conventional model assuming d = 0 leads to a

molecular motor that links membranes to the cytoskeleton via
phosphoinositide binding, so it is particularly important to understand
the mechanics of its membrane attachment. We used optical tweezers to
measure the strength and attachment lifetime of single myo1c molecules as
they bind beads coated with a bilayer of 2\% phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate and 98\% phosphatidylcholine. Adhesion forces measured
under ramp-load ranged between 5.5 and 16 pN at loading rates between 250
and 1800 pN/s. Dissociation rates increased linearly with constant force
(0.3-2.5 pN), with rates exceeding 360 s(-1) at 2.5 pN. Attachment
lifetimes calculated from adhesion force measurements were
loading-rate-dependent, suggesting nonadiabatic behavior during pulling.
The adhesion forces of myo1c with phosphoinositides are greater than the
motors stall forces and are within twofold of the force required to
extract a lipid molecule from the membrane. However, attachment durations
are short-lived, suggesting that phosphoinositides alone do not provide
the mechanical stability required to anchor myo1c to membranes during
multiple ATPase cycles.},

therapeutically has not been assessed. Immunoblotting of p85-associated
proteins in serum-starved PTEN-deficient LNCaP and C4-2 PCa cells showed a
small set of discrete tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, but these proteins
were not recognized by an anti-pYXXM motif antibody and were not found in
PTEN-deficient PC3 PCa cells. LC/MS/MS using label-free proteomics and
immunoblotting showed that p85 was associated primarily with p110beta and
p110delta. An interaction with ErbB3 was also detected but was independent
of ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation and was not required for basal PI3K
activity. Basal tyrosine phosphorylation of p110beta and p110delta could
be blocked by c-Src inhibitors, but this did not suppress PI3K activity,
which was similarly independent of Ras. Basal PI3K activity was mediated
by p110beta in PC3 cells and by both p110beta and p110delta in LNCaP
cells, whereas p110alpha was required for PI3K activation in response to
RTK stimulation by heregulin-beta1. These findings show that basal PI3K

The lipid products of PI3K act as second messengers by binding to and

start of a complex signaling cascade, which ultimately results in the
mediation of cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation,
chemotaxis, survival, trafficking, and glucose homeostasis. Therefore,
PI3Ks play a central role in many cellular functions. The factors that
determine which cellular function is mediated are complex and may be
partly attributed to the diversity that exists at each level of the PI3K
signaling cascade, such as the type of stimulus, the isoform of PI3K, or
the nature of the second messenger lipids. Numerous studies have helped to
elucidate some of the key factors that determine cell fate in the context
of PI3K signaling. For example, the past two years has seen the
publication of many transgenic and knockout mouse studies where either
PI3K or its signaling components are deregulated. These models have helped
to build a picture of the role of PI3K in physiology and indeed there have
been a number of surprises. This review uses such models as a framework to
build a profile of PI3K function within both the cell and the organism and
focuses, in particular, on the role of PI3K in cell regulation, immunity,

the alanine dipeptide. The interaction parameters, particularly the atomic

geometries of complexes between water and model compounds that represented
the backbone and the various side chains. In addition, dipole moments,
experimental heats and free energies of vaporization, solvation and
sublimation, molecular volumes, and crystal pressures and structures were
used in the optimization. The resulting protein parameters were tested by
applying them to noncyclic tripeptide crystals, cyclic peptide crystals,

carbonmonoxy myoglobin in vacuo and in crystals. A detailed analysis of
the relationship between the alanine dipeptide potential energy surface

phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, converting it to
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate to activate protein kinase B/Akt.
This is widely reported to promote tumorigenesis via increased cell
survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion, and many tumor types,
including colorectal cancer, exhibit increased PI3K signaling. To
investigate the effect of inhibiting PI3K and as an alternative to the use
of small molecular inhibitors of PI3K with varying degrees of selectivity,
HT29 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells bearing mutant PIK3CA were
generated that could be induced with doxycycline to express synchronously
a dominant negative subunit of PI3K, Deltap85alpha. On induction,
decreased levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B were detected,
confirming PI3K signaling impairment. Induction of Deltap85alpha in vitro
reduced cell number via accumulation in G(0)-G(1) phase of the cell cycle
in the absence of increased apoptosis. These effects were recapitulated in
vivo. HT29 cells expressing Deltap85alpha and grown as tumor xenografts
had a significantly slower growth rate on administration of doxycycline
with reduced Ki67 staining without increased levels of apoptotic tissue
biomarkers. Furthermore, in vitro Deltap85alpha expression did not
sensitize HT29 cells to oxaliplatin- or etoposide-induced apoptosis,
irrespective of drug treatment schedule. Further analysis comparing
isogenic HCT116 cells with and without mutation in PIK3CA showed no effect
of the mutation in either proliferative or apoptotic response to PI3K
inhibition. These data show in colorectal cancer cells that PI3K
inhibition does not provoke apoptosis per se nor enhance oxaliplatin- or
etoposide-induced cell death.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and
more than 1 million people annually die in consequence of lung cancer.
Although an improvement in lung cancer treatment could be achieved,
especially in the last decade, the development of additional therapeutic
strategies is urgently required in order to provide improved survival
benefit for patients. Lung cancer formation is caused by genetic
modifications commonly caused by tobacco smoking. Numerous studies have
demonstrated the role of extracellular growth factors in lung cancer cell
proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Mutations and
amplifications in molecules related to receptor tyrosine signalling, such
as EGFR, ErbB2, c-Met, c-Kit, VEGFR, PI3K, and PTEN are only some of the
alterations known to contribute to the development of lung cancer. The
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, fundamental for cell
development, growth, and survival, is known to be frequently altered in
neoplasia, including carcinomas of the lung. Based on the high frequency
of alterations, which include mutations and amplifications, leading to
over-activation of certain upstream/downstream mediators, targeting
components of the PI3K signalling pathway is considered to be a promising
therapeutic approach in cancer treatment. In this article we will
summarize the current knowledge about the involvement of PI3K signalling
in lung cancer and discuss the development of targeted therapies involving
PI3K pathway inhibitors.},

	abstract = {Invadopodia are ventral cell protrusions formed in invasive cancer cells.
Because invadopodia have extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation activity,
they are thought to function in cancer invasion. In this study, we
examined the roles of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)]
and PI(4,5)P(2)-producing enzymes in invadopodia formation in MDA-MB-231
human breast cancer cells. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that
PI(4,5)P(2) accumulates at invadopodia on the ventral cell surface.
Injection of an anti-PI(4,5)P(2) antibody inhibited invadopodia formation
along with gelatin degradation activity. Sequestering of PI(4,5)P(2) by
overexpression of the phospholipase C (PLC) delta1-pleckstrin homology
(PH) domain, a specific probe for PI(4,5)P(2), also blocked invadopodia
formation, while a mutated PLCdelta1-PH domain that lacks
PI(4,5)P(2)-binding activity had no effect. Cellular PI(4,5)P(2)
production is mainly mediated by type-I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate
5-kinase (PIP5KI) family proteins, which include PIP5KIalpha, Ibeta, and
Igamma. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that PIP5KIalpha is a
dominant isoform expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of PIP5KIalpha
by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited invadopodia formation and
gelatin degradation. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that endogenous
PIP5KIalpha protein localizes at invadopodia, which is corroborated by the
observation that exogenously expressed green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-fused PIP5KIalpha protein also accumulates at gelatin degradation
sites. These results indicate that localized production of PI(4,5)P(2) by
PIP5KIalpha is required for invadopodia formation and ECM degradation by
human breast cancer cells.},

the localized region. By explicitly computing the free-energy changes and
by quantifying the loss of entropy accompanied with increasing membrane
deformation, we show that the membrane stiffness increases with increasing
intrinsic field, thereby, renormalizing the membrane bending rigidity. The
second main conclusion of this work is that the entropy of the membrane
decreases with increasing size of the localized region subject to the
curvature field. Our results help to quantify the free-energy change when
a planar membrane deforms under the influence of curvature-inducing

calcium ions to sever actin filaments, to potentiate its binding to the
end of the filament and to promote the polymerization of monomeric actin
into filaments. Because transient increases in both intracellular [Ca2+]
and actin polymerization accompany the cellular response to certain
stimuli, it has been suggested that gelsolin regulates the reversible
assembly of actin filaments that accompanies such cellular activations.
But other evidence suggests that these activities do not need increased
cytoplasmic [Ca2+] and that once actin-gelsolin complexes form in the
presence of Ca2+ in vitro, removal of free Ca2+ causes dissociation of
only one of two bound actin monomers from gelsolin and the resultant
binary complexes cannot sever actin filaments. The finding that cellular
gelsolin-actin complexes can be dissociated suggests that a
Ca2+-independent regulation of gelsolin also occurs. Here we show that,
like the dissociation of profilin-actin complexes, phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate, which undergoes rapid turnover during cell stimulation,
strongly inhibits the actin filament-severing properties of gelsolin,
inhibits less strongly the nucleating ability of this protein and restores
the potential for filament-severing activity to gelsolin-actin complexes.},

	abstract = {Leukocyte recruitment from the bloodstream to surrounding tissues is an
essential component of the immune response. Capture of blood-borne
leukocytes onto vascular endothelium proceeds via a two-step mechanism,
with each step mediated by a distinct receptor-ligand pair. Cells first
transiently adhere, or "roll" (via interactions between selectins and
sialyl-Lewis-x), and then firmly adhere to the vascular wall (via
interactions between integrins and ICAM-1). We have reported that a
computational method called adhesive dynamics (AD) accurately reproduces
the fine-scale dynamics of selectin-mediated rolling. This paper extends
the use of AD simulations to model the dynamics of cell adhesion when two
classes of receptors are simultaneously active: one class (selectins or
selectin ligands) with weakly adhesive properties, and the other
(integrins) with strongly adhesive properties. AD simulations predict
synergistic functions of the two receptors in mediating adhesion. At a
fixed density of surface ICAM-1, increasing selectin densities lead to
greater pause times and an increased tendency toward firm adhesion; thus,
selectins mechanistically facilitate firm adhesion mediated by integrins.
Conversely, at a fixed density of surface selectin, increasing ICAM-1
densities lead to greater pause times and an increased tendency to firm
adhesion. We present this relationship in a two-receptor state diagram, a
map that relates the densities and properties of adhesion molecules to
various adhesive behaviors that they code, such as rolling or firm
adhesion. We also present a state diagram for neutrophil activation, which
relates beta(2)-integrin density and integrin-ICAM-1 kinetic on rate to
neutrophil adhesive behavior. The predictions of two-receptor adhesive
dynamics are validated by the ability of the model to reproduce in vivo
neutrophil rolling velocities from the literature.},

scaling and mean-field theories for the polymer brush, together with the

fluid lipid bilayers. Depending on the length and mole fraction of the
polymer lipid, the membrane expansion can be appreciable. Direct
experimental evidence for this lateral expansion comes from recent
spin-label measurements with lipid membranes containing poly(ethylene
glycol)-grafted lipids. The expansion in lipid area modifies the elastic
constants of the polymer-grafted membranes in a way that opposes the
direct elastic response of the polymer itself. Calculations as a function
of polymer lipid content indicate that the net change in isothermal area
expansion modulus of the membrane is negative but small, in contrast to
previous predictions. A similar situation applies to the curvature elastic
moduli of membranes containing short polymer lipids. For longer polymer
lipids, however, the direct contribution of the polymer brush to the
bending elastic constants dominates, and the increase in bending moduli
with increasing polymer lipid content rapidly exceeds the basal values of
the bare lipid membrane. The spontaneous (or intrinsic) curvature of the
component monolayer of polymer lipid-containing membranes is calculated
for the first time. The polymer brush contribution to spontaneous
curvature scales quadratically with the polymer length, and at least
quadratically with the mole fraction of polymer lipid.},

compare the properties of homogeneous monolayers of the corresponding
phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylserines, and
phosphatidic acids with those of control monolayers of
sn-1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl- and sn-1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphoglycerides.
Major findings were: 1), that the presence of an sn-2-docosahexaenoyl
group or an sn-2-arachidonoyl group increases the molecular areas of
phosphoglycerides by 3.8 A(2) (7\%) relative to the presence of an
sn-2-oleoyl group; 2), that the phosphorylcholine headgroup independently
increases molecular areas by a larger amount, 7.1 A(2) (13\%); and 3), that
the dipole moments of species having an arachidonoyl moiety or an oleoyl
moiety are 83 mD (19\%) higher than those of comparable docosahexaenoic
acid-containing phosphoglycerides. These and other results provide new
information about the molecular packing properties of polyenoic
phosphoglycerides and raise important questions about the role of these
phosphoglycerides in synapses.},

	abstract = {HYPOTHESIS: ErbB2 resides in lipid rafts (regions of receptor regulation)
in vestibular schwannoma (VS) cells. BACKGROUND: ErbB2 is a growth factor
receptor critical for Schwann cell (SC) proliferation and development.
ErbB2 localization and activity may be regulated by merlin, an adaptor
protein deficient in VS. Lipid rafts are microdomains in the plasma
membrane that amplify and regulate receptor signaling. Persistence of
erbB2 in lipid rafts in VS due to merlin deficiency may explain increased
VS cell growth. METHODS: Protein extracts from VS or rat sciatic nerve
(proximal or distal to a crush injury) were isolated into lipid raft and
nonraft fractions and immunoblotted for erbB2, phosphorylated erbB2, and
merlin (for sciatic nerve). Cultured VS cells were probed with anti-erbB2
antibody and a lipid raft marker, cholera toxin B (CTB). RESULTS: ErbB2
moves to lipid rafts in proliferating SCs and is persistently localized to
lipid rafts in VS cells. ErbB2 is phosphorylated (activated) in lipid
rafts. ErbB2 colocalized with CTB in cultured VS cells, confirming raft
targeting. Merlin also persistently localized to lipid rafts in SCs, and
its relative phosphorylation increased in proliferating cells. CONCLUSION:
Lipid raft localization of erbB2 in proliferating SCs and in VS cells
supports a critical role for lipid rafts in amplifying/regulating erbB2
signaling. Merlin resides in lipid rafts in SCs, and its phosphorylation
increases in proliferating SCs, suggesting it regulates cell proliferation
within lipid rafts. The absence of merlin in VS may therefore lead to
persistent erbB2 localization to lipid rafts and increased cell
proliferation.},

	abstract = {Inositol phospholipids represent a minor fraction of membrane
phospholipids; yet they play important regulatory functions in signaling
pathways and membrane traffic. The phosphorylated inositol ring can act
either as a precursor for soluble intracellular messengers or as a binding
site for cytosolic or membrane proteins. Hence,
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of phosphoinositides represents a
mechanism for regulation of recruitment to the membrane of coat proteins,
cytoskeletal scaffolds or signaling complexes and for the regulation of
membrane proteins. Recent work suggests that phosphoinositide metabolism
has an important role in membrane traffic at the synapse. PtdIns(4,5)P2
generation is implicated in the secretion of at least a subset of
neurotransmitters. Furthermore, PtdIns(4,5)P2 plays a role in the
nucleation of clathrin coats and of an actin-based cytoskeletal scaffold
at endocytic zones of synapses, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 dephosphorylation
accompanies the release of newly formed vesicles from these interactions.
Thus, the reversible phosphorylation of inositol phospholipids may be one
of the mechanisms governing the timing and vectorial progression of
synaptic vesicle membranes during their exocytic-endocytic cycle.},

domains are detergent-resistant and are highly enriched in the
glycosphingolipid GM1. In this work, the properties of these raft-like
domains are further explored and compared with properties thought to be
central to raft function in plasma membranes. First, it is shown that
domain formation and disruption critically depends on the cholesterol
density and can be controlled reversibly by treating the monolayers with
the cholesterol-sequestering reagent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Second, the
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein Thy-1
significantly partitions into the raft-like domains. The extent of this
partitioning is reduced when the monolayers contain GM1, indicating that
different molecules can compete for domain occupation. Third, the
partitioning of a saturated phospholipid analog into the raft phase is
dramatically increased (15\% to 65\%) after cross-linking with antibodies,
whereas the distribution of a doubly unsaturated phospholipid analog is
not significantly affected by cross-linking (approximately 10\%). This

high-affinity state when associated with sterol-rich lipid microdomains

membranes with cholesterol shifts the receptor into the high-affinity
state, and induces its association with rafts. The receptor was
crosslinked to photocholesterol. Our data suggest that sterol-rich lipid

Lyn that is a critical early event in signaling by this receptor [Field et

the structural bases for these interactions, we examined the phospholipid

electrospray Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
to compare quantitatively the phospholipid composition of isolated DRM to
that of total cell lipids and to a plasma membrane preparation. From these
analyses, over 90 different phospholipid species were spectrally resolved
and unambiguously identified; more than two-thirds of these were
determined with a precision of +/-0.5\% (absolute) or less. Quantitative
characterization of lipid profiles shows that isolated DRM are
substantially enriched in sphingomyelin and in glycerophospholipids with a
higher degree of saturation as compared to total cellular lipids. Plasma
membrane vesicles isolated from RBL-2H3 cells by chemically induced
blebbing exhibit a degree of phospholipid saturation that is intermediate

plasma membrane markers were evenly distributed in the plasma membrane. We
compared the patching behavior of pairs of raft markers (defined by
insolubility in Triton X-100) with pairs of raft/non-raft markers. For
this purpose we cross-linked glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored
proteins placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), Thy-1, influenza virus
hemagglutinin (HA), and the raft lipid ganglioside GM1 using antibodies

extensively in BHK cells as well as in Jurkat T-lymphoma cells.
Importantly, patches of GPI-anchored PLAP accumulated src-like protein
tyrosine kinase fyn, which is thought to be anchored in the cytoplasmic
leaflet of raft domains. In contrast patched raft components and patches
of transferrin receptor as a non-raft marker were sharply separated. Taken
together, our data strongly suggest that coalescence of cross-linked raft
elements is mediated by their common lipid environments, whereas
separation of raft and non-raft patches is caused by the immiscibility of
different lipid phases. This view is supported by the finding that
cholesterol depletion abrogated segregation. Our results are consistent

transporters and channels have been discovered to be regulated by PIP(2).
Systems reported to be activated by PIP(2) include (i) plasmalemmal
calcium pumps (PMCA), (ii) cardiac sodium-calcium exchangers (NCX1), (iii)
sodium-proton exchangers (NHE1-4), (iv) a sodium-magnesium exchanger of
unknown identity, (v) all inward rectifier potassium channels (KATP, IRK,
GIRK, and ROMK channels), (vi) epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), and
(vii) ryanodine-sensitive calcium release channels (RyR). Systems reported
to be inhibited by PIP(2) include (i) cyclic nucleotide-gated channels of
the rod (CNG), (ii) transient receptor potential-like (TRPL) Drosophila
phototransduction channels, (iii) capsaicin-activated transient receptor
potential (TRP) channels (VR1), and (iv) IP(3)-gated calcium release
channels (IP3R). Systems that appear to be completely insensitive to
PIP(2) include (i) voltage-gated sodium channels, (ii) most voltage-gated
potassium channels, (iii) sodium-potassium pumps, (iv) several
neurotransmitter transporters, and (v) cystic fibrosis transmembrane
receptor (CFTR)-type chloride channels. Presumably, local changes of the
concentration of PIP(2) in the plasma membrane represent cell signals to
those mechanisms sensitive to PIP(2) changes. Unfortunately, our
understanding of how local PIP(2) concentrations are regulated remains
very limited. One important complexity is the probable existence of
phospholipid microdomains, or lipid rafts. Such domains may serve to
localize PIP(2) and thereby PIP(2) signaling, as well as to organize
PIP(2) binding partners into signaling complexes. A related biological
role of PIP(2) may be to control the activity of ion transporters and
channels during biosynthesis or vesicle trafficking. Low PIP(2)
concentrations in the secretory pathway would inactivate all of the
systems that are stimulated by PIP(2). How, in detail, is PIP(2) used by
cells to control ion channel and transporter activities? Further progress
requires an improved understanding of lipid kinases and phosphatases, how
they are regulated, where they are localized in cells, and with which ion
channels and transporters they might localize.},

cytosolic calcium, polymerize actin, and change shape. We report that cold
increases barbed end nucleation sites in octyl glucoside-permeabilized
platelets by 3-fold, enabling analysis of the intermediates of this
response. Although chilling does not change polyphosphoinositide (ppI)
levels, a ppI-binding peptide completely inhibits cold-induced nucleation.
The C terminus of N-WASp, which inhibits the Arp2/3 complex, blocks
nucleation by 40\%; GDPbetaS, N17Rac and N17Cdc42 have no effects. Some
gelsolin translocates to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton after
cooling. Chilled platelets from gelsolin-deficient mice have approximately
50\% fewer new actin nuclei compared with platelets from wild-type mice.
EGTA completely inhibits gelsolin translocation into the cytoskeleton, and
the small amount of gelsolin initially there becomes soluble. Chilling
releases adducin from the detergent-resistant cytoskeleton. We conclude
that platelet actin filament assembly induced by cooling involves
ppI-mediated actin filament barbed end uncapping and de novo nucleation
independently of surface receptors or downstream signaling intermediates
besides calcium. The actin-related changes occur in platelets at
temperatures below 37 degrees C, suggesting that the platelet may be more
activable at temperatures at the body surface than at core temperature,

(C16:0-Cer), in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(POPC) matrix were compared. Minor attenuation of lateral diffusion upon
increasing the mole fraction of C16:0-SM (XSM, up to 0.25) was indicated
by the slight decrement in the excimer/monomer intensity ratio (Ie/Im) for
a trace amount (mole fraction X = 0.01) of a pyrene-labeled ceramide
analogue (N-[(pyren)-1-yl]decanoyl-sphingosine, PDCer) in keeping with the
miscibility of C16:0-SM in POPC. Increasing membrane order was revealed by
the augmented polarization P for diphenylhexatriene (DPH). In contrast,
when C16:0-Cer was substituted for C16:0-SM an approximately 1.6-fold
increase in Ie/Im for PDCer was evident upon increasing Xcer, with
parallel increment in DPH polarization. In agreement with our recent data
on natural ceramides in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers
[Holopainen et al. (1997) Chem. Phys. Lipids 88, 1-13], we conclude that
C16:0-Cer becomes enriched into microdomains in the fluid POPC membrane.
Interestingly, enhanced formation of microdomains by ceramide was observed
when the total sphingolipid content in tertiary alloys with POPC was
maintained constant (Xcer + XSM = 0.25) and the SM/Cer stoichiometry was
varied. Finally, when ceramide was generated enzymatically in
POPC/C16:0-SM (3:1, molar fraction) LUVs by sphingomyelinase (SMase,
Bacillus cereus), maximally approximately 85\% of hydrolysis of
sphingomyelin was measured within {\textless}3 min at 30 degreesC. The formation of
ceramide was accompanied by a closely parallel increase in DPH
polarization. There was also an increase in Ie/Im for PDCer; however,
these changes in Ie/Im were significantly slower, requiring approximately
105 min to reach a steady state. These data show that the rapid enzymatic
formation of ceramide under these conditions is followed by much slower
reorganization process, resulting in the formation of microdomains
enriched in this lipid.},

membrane retrieval and dense concentrations of polymerized actin occur in
restricted zones of high endocytic activity. Ultrafast-acquisition and
superresolution deconvolution microscopy of cultured adipocytes expressing
an enhanced green fluorescent protein- or enhanced cyan fluorescent
protein (ECFP)-tagged phospholipase Cdelta1 (PLCdelta1) pleckstrin

large-scale PtdIns(4,5)P2-rich plasma membrane patches (PRMPs). PRMPs
exhibit lateral dimensions exceeding several micrometers, are relatively
stationary, and display extensive local membrane folding that concentrates
PtdIns(4,5)P2 in three-dimensional space. In addition, a higher
concentration of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the membranes of PRMPs than in other
regions of the plasma membrane can be detected by quantitative
fluorescence microscopy. Vesicular structures containing both clathrin
heavy chains and PtdIns(4,5)P2 are revealed immediately beneath PRMPs, as
is dense F actin. Blockade of PtdIns(4,5)P2 function in PRMPs by high
expression of the ECFP-tagged PLCdelta1 PH domain inhibits transferrin
endocytosis and reduces the abundance of cortical F-actin. Membrane
ruffles induced by the expression of unconventional myosin 1c were also
found to localize at PRMPs. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that PRMPs organize active PtdIns(4,5)P2 signaling zones in the

pressure from 15 to 36 mN/m reduced the rate at which PIP2 was hydrolyzed
by PLC beta 1 and PLC beta 2 by 4-6-fold, although PLC beta 1 was more
active than PLC beta 2, even at high surface pressure. Reduced enzyme
activity was accompanied by an increase in reaction induction times,
suggesting that increasing surface pressure reduced the penetration rate
of the enzymes into the monolayer. Quantitation of interfacial enzyme
concentration using 35S-labeled PLC beta 1 confirmed that less enzyme was
associated with the monolayer at higher pressures. The relationship
between PLC activity and substrate concentration was examined at a single
surface pressure of 30 mN/m. This relationship was not hyperbolic, and
increases in the mole percentage (mol \%) of PIP2 in the monolayer resulted
in an upwardly-curving increase in PLC activity. Thus, PLC beta 1 activity
increased 7-fold and PLC beta 2 activity increased 4-fold when the mol \%
of PIP2 in the monolayer increased from 17.9\% to 29\%, increasing further
thereafter. Paradoxically, increasing the mol \% of PIP2 from 0 to 60\% was
accompanied by a 3-fold decrease in interfacial enzyme concentrations.
Taken together, these data show that the catalytic activity of PLC beta
involves some element of penetration of lipid interfaces, and suggest that
the organization of the substrate facilitates PLC activity, giving
credence to the substrate theory of interfacial activation of
phospholipases. We present a hypothesis suggesting that PIP2 molecules
coalesce into enriched lateral domains which favor PLC beta activity.},

phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), with consequent inhibition
of its filament severing activity and dissociation of EGTA-resistant
complexes made with rabbit macrophage or human plasma gelsolin and rabbit
muscle actin. This study provides evidence for an interaction of gelsolin
with phosphatidylinositol monophosphate (PIP) as well as PIP2 and further
describes their effects on gelsolin's function. Both phosphoinositides
completely dissociate EGTA-insensitive rabbit macrophage cytoplasmic
gelsolin-actin complexes and inhibit gelsolin's severing activity. The
magnitude of inhibition depends strongly on the physical state of the
phosphoinositides, being maximal in preparations that contain small
micelles of either purified PIP or PIP2. Aggregation of PIP or PIP2
micelles by divalent cations or insufficient sonication or their
incorporation into vesicles containing other phospholipids decreases but
does not eliminate the inhibitory properties of the polyphosphoinositides.
The presence of gelsolin partly inhibits the divalent cation-induced
aggregation of PIP2 micelles. PIP2 in combination with EGTA inactivates
gelsolin molecules that block the fast-growing end of actin filaments,
thereby accelerating actin polymerization. Regulation of gelsolin by the
intracellular messengers Ca2+ and polyphosphoinositides allows for the
formation of several different gelsolin-actin intermediates with distinct

the three proteins accumulate at rafts, where they codistribute with
PI(4,5)P(2), and promote its retention and clustering. Binding and
modulation of PI(4, 5)P(2) depended on the basic effector domain (ED) of

compositions. In this review, we discuss how the biophysical properties of
the membrane bilayer and the chemistry of individual lipid molecules play
a role in the intracellular trafficking of the lipids themselves, as well
as influencing the trafficking of transmembrane proteins. The large
diversity of lipid head groups and acyl chains lead to a variety of weak
interactions, such as ionic and hydrogen bonding at the lipid/water
interfacial region, hydrophobic interactions, and van-der-Waals
interactions based on packing density. In simple model bilayers, these
weak interactions can lead to large-scale phase separations, but in more
complex mixtures, which mimic cell membranes, such phase separations are
not observed. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that domains (i.e.,
localized regions with non-random lipid compositions) exist in biological
membranes, and it is likely that the formation of these domains are based
on interactions similar to those that lead to phase separations in model
systems. Sorting of lipids appears to be based in part on the inclusion or
exclusion of certain types of lipids in vesicles or tubules as they bud
from membrane organelles.},

plasma membranes, usually constituting a mixture of several molecular
species with various fatty acyl chain moieties. In this work, we utilize
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the differences in
structural and dynamical properties of bilayers comprised of the most
common natural SM species. Keeping the sphingosine moiety unchanged, we
vary the amide bonded acyl chain from 16 to 24 carbons in length and
examine the effect of unsaturation by comparing lipids with saturated and
monounsaturated chains. As for structural properties, we find a slight
decrease in average area per lipid and a clear linear increase in bilayer
thickness with increasing acyl chain length both in saturated and
unsaturated systems. Increasing the acyl chain length is found to further
the interdigitation across the bilayer center. This is related to the
dynamics of SM molecules, as the lateral diffusion rates decrease slightly
for an increasing acyl chain length. Interdigitation also plays a role in
interleaflet friction, which is stronger for unsaturated chains. The
effect of the cis double bond is most significant on the local order
parameters and rotation rates of the chains, though unsaturation shows
global effects on overall lipid packing and dynamics as well. Regarding
hydrogen bonding or properties related to the lipid/water interface
region, no significant effects were observed due to varying chain length
or unsaturation. The significance of the findings presented is discussed.},

highly dynamic, sterol- and sphingolipid-enriched domains that
compartmentalize cellular processes. Small rafts can sometimes be
stabilized to form larger platforms through protein-protein and

full-length N-WASP is a weak activator of Arp2/3 complex, its activity can
be enhanced by upstream regulators such as Cdc42 and PI(4,5)P(2). We
dissected this activation reaction and found that the previously described
physical interaction between the NH(2)-terminal domain and the
COOH-terminal effector domain of N-WASP is a regulatory interaction
because it can inhibit the actin nucleation activity of the effector
domain by occluding the Arp2/3 binding site. This interaction between the
NH(2)- and COOH termini must be intramolecular because in solution N-WASP
is a monomer. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2))
influences the activity of N-WASP through a conserved basic sequence
element located near the Cdc42 binding site rather than through the WASp
homology domain 1. Like Cdc42, PI(4,5)P(2) reduces the affinity between
the NH(2)- and COOH termini of the molecule. The use of a mutant N-WASP
molecule lacking this basic stretch allowed us to delineate a signaling
pathway in Xenopus extracts leading from PI(4, 5)P(2) to actin nucleation
through Cdc42, N-WASP, and Arp2/3 complex. In this pathway, PI(4,5)P(2)
serves two functions: first, as an activator of N-WASP; and second, as an
indirect activator of Cdc42.},

	abstract = {Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins can be isolated from
both cells and sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich liposomes (SCRLs) in
association with detergent-insoluble membranes. We found previously that
detergent insolubility of lipids was characteristic of phases in which
lipid acyl chains are ordered. We presented evidence that GPI-anchored
proteins are insoluble because they associate with cholesterol and
sphingolipid-rich lipid domains with properties similar to the
liquid-ordered phase. Here, this model was tested by a variety of
approaches. First, we demonstrated that saponin, which removes cholesterol
from cell membranes and allows solubilization of GPI-anchored proteins by
Triton X-100, had the same effect on the GPI-anchored protein alkaline
phosphatase (PLAP) in SCRLs of appropriate lipid composition. The
similarity of saponin action in cells and simple liposomes suggests that
the compound disrupts protein-lipid interactions. However, direct
interactions between PLAP and cholesterol were not needed for
insolubility, because the protein was also insoluble in cholesterol-free
liposomes containing lipid in an ordered phase. Instead, cholesterol acted
by greatly enhancing the formation of a detergent-insoluble phase by
sphingolipids, which have a tendency to form ordered phases. We propose
that saponin solubilizes GPI-anchored proteins because the lipid
composition of cell membranes (and the SCRLs used above) supports ordered
phase formation in the presence but not the absence of cholesterol.
Supporting this model, saponin did not promote Triton X-100 solubilization
of PLAP in SCRLs with sphingolipid levels high enough to allow ordered
phase formation in the absence of cholesterol. We also showed that two
additional GPI-anchored proteins are detergent-insoluble in SCRLs and that
detergent does not artifactually create ordered domains or cause
components of solubilized membranes to associate with detergent-resistant
membranes present in separate bilayers in the same lysate. We conclude
that the ordered domain model explains the behavior of detergent-resistant
membranes in liposomes and cells.},

but fast diffusion, with high partitioning (approximately 100-fold) and
long residence time (approximately 13 s). The analogous probe with
mono-unsaturated chains diffused predominantly unconfined within the

locations, sizes, shapes and motions of individual domains became clearly
visible. Domains had a size of 0.7 micrometer (0.2-2 micrometer), covering
approximately 13\% of total membrane area. Both the liquid-ordered phase
characteristics and the sizes of domains match properties of membrane

same, homogeneously distributed PIP2 pool at the plasma membrane, even
though the neurokinin A receptor is localized to microdomains and is
cholesterol dependent in its PIP2 signaling whereas the endothelin
receptor is not. Our experiments further indicate that detergent treatment
causes PIP2 clustering and that cholesterol depletion interferes with
basal, ligand-independent recycling of the neurokinin A receptor, thereby
providing alternative explanations for the enrichment of PIP2 in
detergent-insoluble membrane fractions and for the cholesterol dependency
of PIP2 breakdown, respectively.},

cytoskeleton. Indeed, recent studies that use GFP-tagged pleckstrin
homology domains (GFP-PH) as fluorescent PIP(2) sensors suggest that this
lipid is enriched in membrane microdomains. Here we report that this
concept needs revision. Using three distinct fluorescent GFP-tagged
pleckstrin homology domains, we show that highly mobile GFP-PH patches
colocalize perfectly with various lipophilic membrane dyes and, hence,
represent increased lipid content rather than PIP(2)-enriched
microdomains. We show that bright patches are caused by submicroscopical
folds and ruffles in the membrane that can be directly visualized at
approximately 15 nm axial resolution with a novel numerically enhanced
imaging method. F-actin motility is inhibited significantly by
agonist-induced PIP(2) breakdown, and it resumes as soon as PIP(2) levels
are back to normal. Thus, our data support a role for PIP(2) in the
regulation of cortical actin, but they challenge a model in which spatial
differences in PIP(2) regulation of the cytoskeleton exist at a micrometer

that the extent of energy transfer for the GPI-anchored folate-receptor

sub-pixel-sized domains at the surface of living cells; however, the
extent of energy transfer for the transmembrane-anchored folate-receptor
isoform was density-dependent, which is consistent with a random
distribution. These domains are likely to be less than 70 nm in diameter
and are disrupted by removal of cellular cholesterol. These results

with those of PLCdelta(1)PH-GFP. The N-terminal ligand binding domain of
the type I InsP(3) receptor also failed to localize to the plasma membrane

using a chimeric approach and cassette mutagenesis, the C-terminal
alpha-helix and the short loop between the beta6-beta7 sheets of the

suggest the binding is driven mainly by nonspecific local electrostatic
interactions. First, peptides with 13 basic residues, Lys-13 and Arg-13,
bind to PIP(2)-containing vesicles with the same high affinity as the
effector domain peptide. Second, removing basic residues from the effector
domain peptide reduces the binding energy by an amount that correlates
with the number of charges removed. Third, peptides corresponding to a
basic region in GAP43 and MARCKS effector domain-like regions in other
proteins (e.g. MacMARCKS, adducin, Drosophila A kinase anchor protein 200,
and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor) also bind with an energy that
correlates with the number of basic residues. Kinetic measurements suggest
the effector domain binds to several PIP(2). Theoretical calculations show
the effector domain produces a local positive potential, even when bound
to a bilayer with 33\% monovalent acidic lipids, and should thus sequester
PIP(2) laterally. This electrostatic sequestration was observed
experimentally using a phospholipase C assay. Our results are consistent

used high resolution magic angle spinning NMR to establish the location of
MARCKS-(151-175) in membrane bilayers, which is necessary to understand
the sequestration mechanism. Measurements of cross-relaxation rates in
two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy NMR
experiments show that the five Phe rings of MARCKS-(151-175) penetrate
into the acyl chain region of phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing
phosphatidylglycerol or PI(4,5)P2. Specifically, we observed strong
cross-peaks between the aromatic protons of the Phe rings and the acyl
chain protons of the lipids, even for very short (50 ms) mixing times. The
position of the Phe rings implies that the adjacent positively charged
amino acids in the peptide are close to the level of the negatively
charged lipid phosphates. The deep location of the MARCKS peptide in the
polar head group region should enhance its electrostatic sequestration of
PI(4,5)P2 by an "image charge" mechanism. Moreover, this location has
interesting implications for membrane curvature and local surface pressure
effects and may be relevant to a wide variety of other proteins with

determining both fundamental properties and biological relevance of
membrane domains. Line tension at fluid lipid bilayer membrane domain
boundaries controls the kinetics of domain growth and therefore regulates
the size of compositional heterogeneities. High line tension promotes
membrane domain budding and fission. Line tension could therefore be an
important control parameter regulating functional aspects of biological
membranes. Here the established method of fluid domain flicker
spectroscopy is applied to examine thermal domain wall fluctuations of
phase-separated bilayer membranes. We find a Gaussian probability
distribution for the first few excited mode amplitudes, which permits an
analysis by means of appropriately specialized capillary wave theory. Time
autocorrelation functions are found to decay exponentially, and relaxation
times are fitted by means of a hydrodynamic theory relating line tensions
and excited mode relaxation kinetics. Line tensions below 1 pN are
obtained, with these two approaches yielding similar results. We examine

organization are poorly understood and are the subject of ongoing
investigation and discussion. Here, we study one proposed mechanism: the
crosslinking of membrane components. In immune cell signaling (and other
membrane-associated processes), a small change in the clustering of
specific membrane proteins can lead to large-scale reorganizations that
involve numerous other membrane components. We have investigated the
large-scale physical effect of crosslinking a minor membrane component,
the ganglioside GM1, in simple lipid models of the plasma membrane
containing sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine. We observe
that crosslinking GM1 can cause uniform membranes to phase-separate into
large, coexistent liquid ordered and liquid disordered membrane domains.
We also find that this lipid separation causes a dramatic redistribution
of a transmembrane peptide, consistent with a raft model of membrane
organization. These experiments demonstrate a mechanism that could
contribute to the effects of crosslinking observed in cellular processes:

The identity of the phases, their location in composition space, and the

detection requires high compositional resolution, on the order of 2\%
compositional increments. Sample artifacts, especially the precipitation

Self-quenching of the dye fluorescence can be significant, distorting the
data at dye concentrations that intuitively might be considered
acceptable. Even more simple than FRET experiments, measurements of
single-dye fluorescence can be used to find phase boundaries. Both FRET

the Gouy-Chapman-Stern (GCS) theory described adequately the dependence of
potential on distance (0, 1, 2 nm) from the membrane, mole \% negative

identical surface potentials with a PC/PI membrane. With PC/PIP2

GCS theory were greater for the coions than the counterions.
Discreteness-of-charge theories based on the Poisson-Boltzmann equation
incorrectly predict that deviations from the GCS theory should be greater

mechanical theory that takes into account three effects ignored in the GCS

domain is functionally and structurally modular. These results demonstrate
stereo-specific high-affinity binding by an isolated PH domain and further
support a functional role for PH domains in the regulation of PLC
isoforms. Other PH domains did not bind strongly to the compounds tested,
suggesting that inositol phosphates and phospholipids are not likely
physiological ligands for all PH domains. Nonetheless, since all
PH-domain-containing proteins are associated with membrane surfaces,
several PH domains bind to specific sites on membranes, and PH domains

	abstract = {Endocytosis in budding yeast is thought to occur in several phases. First,
the membrane invaginates and then elongates into a tube. A vesicle forms
at the end of the tube, eventually pinching off to form a "free" vesicle.
Experiments show that actin polymerization is an active participant in the
endocytic process, along with a number of membrane-associated proteins.
Here we investigate the possible roles of these components in driving
vesiculation by constructing a quantitative model of the process beginning
at the stage where the membrane invagination has elongated into a tube
encased in a sheath of membrane-associated protein. This protein sheath
brings about the scission step where the vesicle separates from the tube.
When the protein sheath is dynamin, it is commonly assumed that scission
is brought about by the constriction of the sheath. Here, we show that an
alternative scenario can work as well: The protein sheath acts as a
"filter" to effect a phase separation of lipid species. The resulting line
tension tends to minimize the interface between the tube region and the
vesicle region. Interestingly, large vesicle size can further facilitate
the reduction of the interfacial diameter down to a few nanometers, small
enough so that thermal fluctuations can fuse the membrane and pinch off
the vesicle. To deform the membrane into the tubular vesicle shape, the
membrane elastic resistance forces must be balanced by some additional
forces that we show can be generated by actin polymerization and/or myosin
I. These active forces are shown to be important in successful scission
processes as well.},

structure of the lipid membranes was strongly affected by the presence of
lithium, as manifested by the observation of a transition from a
disordered to a gel state. Concerning the mechanism of such a transition,
it was associated to the dehydration that we detected in the lipid-water
interface in the presence of lithium. This dehydration introduced an
increase in the lipid-lipid interactions, and as a consequence, a
diminution of the disorder of the membrane. When both types of ions are
present in the aqueous phase, lithium shown a special affinity for the
lipid membrane displacing almost all the sodium ions toward the middle of
the water layer. As a result, we observed remarkable differences in the
atom and electric field distributions across the lipid membrane.
Concerning the diffusion and orientation of water molecules across the
lipid-water interface, we also observed a strong dependency of the type
ion. On the other hand, the mobility and the hydration shell of lithium
and sodium ions are strongly perturbed by the presence of the charged
lipid bilayer. The lipid layer was responsible for a dehydration of the
ions compared to bulk water. This dehydration was compensated by an
increase of coordination number of the ions with the lipid oxygens. Also,
the residence times of water in the first hydration shell of lithium and
sodium ions are perturbed by the presence of the lipid membrane.},

chemistry of liquids. An avenue to the solution of some of these problems
has been opened by the discovery of liquid-liquid immiscibility in
synthetic membranes composed of cholesterol and phospholipids. This
discovery has led to the development of a thermodynamic model involving
condensed complexes. In this model, the phospholipids with longer
fatty-acid chains react reversibly with cholesterol to form complexes. The
complexes themselves can have a repulsive interaction with other
phospholipids, leading to immiscibility. A striking example of this effect
is revealed in the phase diagrams of ternary mixtures of cholesterol, a
saturated phosphatidylcholine (or sphingomyelin), and an unsaturated
phosphatidylcholine. As found by a number of investigators, all binary
pairs are miscible in bilayers, whereas the ternary mixture can form two
liquid phases. The model of condensed complexes accounts for this effect.
Condensed complexes also have a major effect on the chemical activity of
cholesterol and on the ordering of phospholipid acyl chains both in the
presence and absence of phase separations. Model calculations of
phospholipid order parameters account for several features of the
deuterium NMR spectra of labeled phospholipid molecules in bilayer

function to sequester phosphoinositides within the plane of the bilayer.
To characterize this interaction with phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2)), a novel spin-labeled derivative,
proxyl-PIP(2), was synthesized and characterized. In the presence of
molecules known to bind PI(4,5)P(2) the EPR spectrum of this label
exhibits an increase in line width because of a decrease in label
dynamics, and titration of this probe with neomycin yields the expected
1:1 stoichiometry. Thus, this probe can be used to quantitate the
interactions made by the PI(4,5)P(2) head group within the bilayer. In the
presence of a peptide comprising the effector domain of MARCKS the EPR
spectrum broadens, but the changes in line shape are modulated by both
changes in label correlation time and spin-spin interactions. This result
indicates that at least some proxyl-PIP(2) are in close proximity when
bound to MARCKS and that MARCKS associates with multiple PI(4,5)P(2)
molecules. Titration of the proxyl-PIP(2) EPR signal by the MARCKS-derived
peptide also suggests that multiple PI(4,5)P(2) molecules interact with
MARCKS. Site-directed spin labeling of this peptide shows that the
position and conformation of this protein segment at the membrane
interface are not altered significantly by binding to PI(4,5)P(2). These
data are consistent with the hypothesis that MARCKS functions to sequester
multiple PI(4,5)P(2) molecules within the plane of the membrane as a
result of interactions that are driven by electrostatic forces.},

below a(c) [unk]50 A(2) per molecule forces the binary mixture through a
critical point, where the monolayer becomes homogeneous. At molecular
areas approximately 10\% above this critical area, we observe shape
transitions from liquid domains with circular shapes to domains with less
symmetrical shapes. Shape transitions and critical shape fluctuations can
also be triggered with light, due to photochemical effects on the
monolayer. Shape fluctuations of lipid domains can thus be used to sense
chemical events at the air-water interface.},

approach compares the efficiency of energy transfer between two matched
fluorescent lipid donors, differing in their affinities for ordered versus
disordered regions of the bilayer, and an acceptor lipid that distributes
preferentially into disordered regions. Inhomogeneities in bilayer
organization, on spatial scales of tens of nanometers or greater, are
detected as a marked difference in the efficiencies of quenching of
fluorescence of the two donor species by the acceptor. Using a novel pair
of 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD)-labeled tetraacyl lipids as
donor species with a rhodaminyl-labeled acceptor, this strategy faithfully
reports homo- versus inhomogeneous mixing in each of several lipid bilayer
systems whose organization on the FRET distance scale can be predicted
from previous findings. Interestingly, however, the present FRET method
reports clear evidence of inhomogeneity in the organization of mixtures
combining sphingomyelin or saturated phospholipids with unsaturated
phospholipids and physiological proportions of cholesterol, even at
physiological temperatures where these systems have been reported to
appear homogeneous by fluorescence microscopy. These results indicate that

unresolvable rafts in lipid bilayers, membrane tension led to the
appearance of large, observable rafts. The large rafts converted back to
small ones when tension was relieved. Thus, tension reversibly controls
raft enlargement. For cells, application of membrane tension resulted in
several types of large domains; one class of the domains was identified as
rafts. Tension was generated in several ways, and all yielded raft
fractions that had essentially the same composition, validating the
principle of tension as a means to merge small rafts into large rafts. It
was demonstrated that sphingomyelin-rich vesicles do not rise during
centrifugation in sucrose gradients because they resist lysis,
necessitating that, contrary to current experimental practice, membrane
material be placed toward the top of a gradient for raft fractionation.
Isolated raft fractions were enriched in a GPI-linked protein, alkaline
phosphatase, and were poor in Na(+)-K(+) ATPase. Sphingomyelin and
gangliosides were concentrated in rafts, the expected lipid raft
composition. Cholesterol, however, was distributed equally between raft

Understanding the structure and dynamics of lipid domains could be a key
to many crucial membrane-associated processes in cells. However, one
shortcoming in the field is the lack of routinely applicable techniques to
measure raft association without perturbation by detergents. We show that
both in cell and in domain-exhibiting model membranes, fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can easily distinguish a raft marker
(cholera toxin B subunit bound to ganglioside (GM1) and a nonraft marker
(dialkylcarbocyanine dye diI)) by their decidedly different diffusional
mobilities. In contrast, these markers exhibit only slightly different
mobilities in a homogeneous artificial membrane. Performing cholesterol
depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, which disrupts raft organization,
we find an analogous effect of reduced mobility for the nonraft marker in
domain-exhibiting artificial membranes and in cell membranes. In contrast,
cholesterol depletion has differential effects on the raft marker, cholera
toxin B subunit-GM1, rendering it more mobile in artificial
domain-exhibiting membranes but leaving it immobile in cell membranes,
where cytoskeleton disruption is required to achieve higher mobility.
Thus, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy promises to be a valuable tool
to elucidate lipid raft associations in native cells and to gain deeper
insight into the correspondence between model and natural membranes.},

glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich lipid domains can be driven solely
by characteristic lipid-lipid interactions, suggesting that rafts ought to
form in model membranes composed of appropriate lipids. In fact, domains
with raft-like properties were found to coexist with fluid lipid regions
in both planar supported lipid layers and in giant unilamellar vesicles
(GUVs) formed from 1) equimolar mixtures of
phospholipid-cholesterol-sphingomyelin or 2) natural lipids extracted from
brush border membranes that are rich in sphingomyelin and cholesterol.
Employing headgroup-labeled fluorescent phospholipid analogs in planar
supported lipid layers, domains typically several microns in diameter were
observed by fluorescence microscopy at room temperature (24 degrees C)
whereas non-raft mixtures (PC-cholesterol) appeared homogeneous. Both raft
and non-raft domains were fluid-like, although diffusion was slower in
raft domains, and the probe could exchange between the two phases.
Consistent with the raft hypothesis, GM1, a glycosphingolipid (GSL), was
highly enriched in the more ordered domains and resistant to detergent
extraction, which disrupted the GSL-depleted phase. To exclude the
possibility that the domain structure was an artifact caused by the lipid
layer support, GUVs were formed from the synthetic and natural lipid
mixtures, in which the probe, LAURDAN, was incorporated. The emission
spectrum of LAURDAN was examined by two-photon fluorescence microscopy,
which allowed identification of regions with high or low order of lipid
acyl chain alignment. In GUVs formed from the raft lipid mixture or from
brush border membrane lipids an array of more ordered and less ordered
domains that were in register in both monolayers could reversibly be
formed and disrupted upon cooling and heating. Overall, the notion that in
biomembranes selected lipids could laterally aggregate to form more
ordered, detergent-resistant lipid rafts into which glycosphingolipids
partition is strongly supported by this study.},

We show that lowering cholesterol levels induces formation of visible

types with complementary distributions of fluorescent lipid analogs with
preferences for fluid or ordered domains. A uniform distribution is
restored by cholesterol repletion. Unexpectedly, cholesterol depletion
does not visibly alter the distribution of a crosslinked or uncrosslinked
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (the folate receptor). We
also examined the effect of varying cholesterol content on the cold Triton
X-100 solubility of several membrane constituents. Although a cholesterol
analog, dehydroergosterol, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
protein are largely retained after extraction, a lipid analog with
saturated 16-carbon acyl chains is largely removed when the cellular
cholesterol level is lowered. This result indicates that after cholesterol

could be divided into two groups according to their diffusion
characteristics. At room temperature ( approximately 25 degrees C), one
group showed fast diffusion and complete recovery. The other diffused
three to four times slower and, more importantly, displayed only partial
recovery. Only the first group comprises proteins that are believed to be
associated with lipid rafts. The partial recovery is not caused by
topological constraints (microvilli, etc.), cytoskeletal constraints, or
protein-protein interactions, because all proteins show 100\% recovery in
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments at 37 degrees C. In
addition, the raft-associated proteins cannot be coclustered by antibodies
on the apical membrane at 12 degrees C. The interpretation that best fits
these data is that the apical membrane of epithelial cells is a
phase-separated system with a continuous (percolating) raft phase {\textless}25
degrees C in which isolated domains of the nonraft phase are dispersed,
whereas at 37 degrees C the nonraft phase becomes the continuous phase
with isolated domains of the raft phase dispersed in it.},

phosphatidylcholines (PC) with amide-linked or sn-2 linked acyl chains

chain length and degree of unsaturation affected the interaction of
cholesterol with these phospholipids in model membrane systems. Monolayers
of saturated SMs and PCs with acyl chain lengths above 14 carbons were
condensed and displayed a high collapse pressure ( approximately 70 mN/m).
Monolayers of N-14:0-SM and 1(16:0)-2(14:0)-PC had a much lower collapse
pressure (58-60 mN/m) and monounsaturated SMs collapsed at approximately
50 mN/m. The relative interaction of cholesterol with these phospholipids
was determined at 22 degreesC by measuring the rate of cholesterol
desorption from mixed monolayers (50 mol \% cholesterol; 20 mN/m) to
beta-cyclodextrin in the subphase (1.7 mM). The rate of cholesterol
desorption was lower from saturated SM monolayers than from chain-matched
PC monolayers. In SM monolayers, the rate of cholesterol desorption was
very slow for all N-linked chains, whereas for PC monolayers we could
observe higher desorption rates from monolayers of longer PCs. These
results show that cholesterol interacts favorably with SMs (low rate of
desorption), whereas its interaction (or miscibility) with long chain PCs
is weaker. Introduction of a single cis-unsaturation in the N-linked acyl
chain of SMs led to faster rates of cholesterol desorption as compared
with saturated SMs. The exception was monolayers of N-22:1-SM and
N-24:1-SM from which cholesterol desorbed almost as slowly as from the
corresponding saturated SM monolayers. The results of this study suggest
that cholesterol is most likely capable of interacting with all
physiologically relevant (including long-chain) SMs present in the plasma

evidence for such phase separation is indirect, and so far there has been
no direct demonstration of differences in the ordering and dynamics for
the lipids in these two types of regions or their relative amounts in the
plasma membranes of live cells. In this study, we provide direct evidence
for the presence of two different types of lipid populations in the plasma

L(d), with distinct order parameters and rotational diffusion coefficients
but with some differences among the four cell lines. These results suggest
that coexistence of lipid domains that differ significantly in their
dynamic order in the plasma membrane is a general phenomenon. The L(o)
region is found to be a major component in contrast to a model in which
small liquid-ordered lipid rafts exist in a 'sea' of disordered lipids.

investigated. The phase diagram was established and the different regions
of the phase diagram characterized with respect to the microstructure by
2H NMR, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and other techniques. Three
liquid crystalline (LC) phases were identified: cubic, lamellar and
hexagonal. All LC phases are stable in the temperature range 20–65 °C. The
cubic phase is stable only in a narrow composition range. Upon increasing
the lecithin content the phase transforms to the lamellar phase via an
extended biphasic area. Drying of the lamellar phase leads to the
formation of hexagonal phase. Adding salt to the ternary mixtures causes a
slight increase in the unit cell dimension of the LC phases. Very high
ionic strength may lead to DNA release from liquid crystals and the
formation of DNA free liquid crystalline phases. In particular we observe
a coexistence of two lamellar phases. One contains DNA and one being

condensation: condensing agents, morphology, kinetics, and reversibility,

summarizes the statistical mechanics of the collapse of stiff polymers,
which shows why DNA condensation is abrupt and why toroids are favored
structures. Various ways to estimate or measure intermolecular forces in
DNA condensation are discussed, all of them agreeing that the free energy
change per base pair is very small, on the order of 1\% of thermal energy.
Experimental evidence is surveyed showing that DNA condensation occurs
when about 90\% of its charge is neutralized by counterions. The various
intermolecular forces whose interplay gives rise to DNA condensation are
then reviewed. The entropy loss upon collapse of the expanded wormlike
coil costs free energy, and stiffness sets limits on tight curvature.
However, the dominant contributions seem to come from ions and water.
Electrostatic repulsions must be overcome by high salt concentrations or
by the correlated fluctuations of territorially bound multivalent cations.
Hydration must be adjusted to allow a cooperative accommodation of the
water structure surrounding surface groups on the DNA helices as they
approach. Undulations of the DNA in its confined surroundings extend the
range of the electrostatic forces. The condensing ions may also subtly
modify the local structure of the double helix.},

The juvenile isoform of the neuronal microtubule-associated protein 2

interactions between microfilaments and microtubules. To approach this
problem in vivo, we used the human melanoma cell, M2, which lacks
actin-binding protein-280 (ABP-280) and forms membrane blebs, which are
not seen in wild-type or ABP-transfected cells. The microinjection of tau
or mature MAP2 rescued the blebbing phenotype; MAP2c not only caused
cessation of blebbing but also induced the formation of two distinct
cellular structures. These were actin-rich lamellae, which often included
membrane ruffles, and microtubule-bearing processes. The lamellae
collapsed after treatment with cytochalasin D, and the processes retracted
after treatment with colchicine. MAP2c was immunocytochemically visualized
in zones of the cell that were devoid of tubulin, such as regions within
the lamellae and in association with membrane ruffles. In vitro rheometry
confirmed that MAP2c is an efficient actin gelation protein capable of
organizing actin filaments into an isotropic array at very low
concentrations; tau and mature MAP2 do not share this rheologic property.
These results suggest that MAP2c engages in functionally specific
interactions not only with microtubules but also with microfilaments.},

of actin was resolved from crystals in the absence of cocrystallized actin
binding proteins (ABPs), 2) the prokaryotic ancestral gene of actin was
crystallized and its function as a bacterial cytoskeleton was revealed,
and 3) the structure of the Arp2/3 complex was described for the first
time. In this review we selected several ABPs (ADF/cofilin, profilin,
gelsolin, thymosin beta4, DNase I, CapZ, tropomodulin, and Arp2/3) that
regulate actin-driven assembly, i.e., movement that is independent of
motor proteins. They were chosen because 1) they represent a family of
related proteins, 2) they are widely distributed in nature, 3) an atomic
structure (or at least a plausible model) is available for each of them,
and 4) each is expressed in significant quantities in cells. These ABPs
perform the following cellular functions: 1) they maintain the population
of unassembled but assembly-ready actin monomers (profilin), 2) they
regulate the state of polymerization of filaments (ADF/cofilin, profilin),
3) they bind to and block the growing ends of actin filaments (gelsolin),
4) they nucleate actin assembly (gelsolin, Arp2/3, cofilin), 5) they sever
actin filaments (gelsolin, ADF/cofilin), 6) they bind to the sides of
actin filaments (gelsolin, Arp2/3), and 7) they cross-link actin filaments

microenvironment of the helix. The two basic structures formed by both
linear and covalently closed-circular DNA are: a left-handed supercoil
characteristic of minimally charge-shielded DNA, and a smooth rod
characteristic of fully charge-shielded DNA. We propose that in the
supercoil, the double helix is overwound (increased turn-angle), while in
the rod, the helix is folded back and forth on itself. Variation of these
two basic structures are the beaded fiber of DNA obtained with partially
charge-shielded DNA and the toroid formed by the bending of the DNA rod
and fusion of its ends in the presence of certain cations. We compare the
DNA packaging inside these in vitro generated structures to DNA packaging
in chromatin and viral capsids, and conclude that the packaging of DNA

mechanism by which these enzymes are compartmentalized, and, as a result,
may possibly play important roles for: regulation of the glycolytic
pathway, potential substrate channeling, and increasing glycolytic flux.
Historically, in vitro experiments have shown that many enzyme/actin
interactions are dependent on ionic strength. Herein, Brownian dynamics
(BD) examines how ionic strength impacts the energetics of the association
of F-actin with the glycolytic enzymes: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (aldolase), and triose phosphate
isomerase (TPI). The BD simulations are steered by electrostatics
calculated by Poisson-Boltzmann theory. The BD results confirm
experimental observations that the degree of association diminishes as
ionic strength increases but also suggest that these interactions are
significant, at physiological ionic strengths. Furthermore, BD agrees with
experiments that muscle LDH, aldolase, and GAPDH interact significantly
with F-actin whereas TPI does not. BD indicates similarities in binding
regions for aldolase and LDH among the different species investigated.
Furthermore, the residues responsible for salt bridge formation in stable
complexes persist as ionic strength increases. This suggests the
importance of the residues determined for these binary complexes and
specificity of the interactions. That these interactions are conserved
across species, and there appears to be a general trend among the enzymes,
support the importance of these enzyme-F-actin interactions in creating
initial complexes critical for compartmentation.},

strongly crosslinked gels of semiflexible polymers, which stiffen at large

lamellar CL-DNA self-assemblies as a function of lipid composition and
lipid/DNA ratio, aimed at elucidating the interactions determining their
structure, charge, and thermodynamic stability. The driving force for the
formation of charge-neutral complexes is the release of DNA and lipid
counterions. Negatively charged complexes have a higher DNA packing
density than isoelectric complexes, whereas positively charged ones have a
lower packing density. This indicates that the overcharging of the complex
away from its isoelectric point is caused by changes of the bulk structure
with absorption of excess DNA or cationic lipid. The degree of
overcharging is dependent on the membrane charge density, which is
controlled by the ratio of neutral to cationic lipid in the bilayers.
Importantly, overcharged complexes are observed to move toward their
isoelectric charge-neutral point at higher concentration of salt co-ions,
with positively overcharged complexes expelling cationic lipid and
negatively overcharged complexes expelling DNA. Our observations should
apply universally to the formation and structure of self-assemblies

Bundles form fast, simultaneously with the polymerization of
MgATP-G-actins, upon the addition of polycations to solutions of actins at
low ionic strength conditions. This indicates that nuclei and/or nascent
filaments bundle due to attractive, electrostatic effect of polycations
and the neutralization of repulsive interactions of negative charges on
actin. The attractive forces between the filaments are strong, as shown by
the low (in nanomolar range) critical concentration of their bundling at
low ionic strength. These bundles are sensitive to ionic strength and
disassemble partially in 100 mM NaCl, but both the dissociation and ionic
strength sensitivity can be countered by higher polycation concentrations.
Cys374 residues of actin monomers residing on neighboring filaments in the
bundles can be cross-linked by the short span (5.4Å) MTS-1 (1,1-methanedyl
bismethanethiosulfonate) cross-linker, which indicates a tight packing of
filaments in the bundles. The interfilament cross-links, which connect
monomers located on oppositely oriented filaments, prevent disassembly of
bundles at high ionic strength. Cofilin and the polysaccharide polyanion
heparin disassemble lysozyme induced actin bundles more effectively than
the polylysine-induced bundles. The actin-lysozyme bundles are
pathologically significant as both proteins are found in the pulmonary

brain homogenates, synapsin I decreases the steady-state viscosity of

bundles actin filaments. Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent kinase has
minimal effect on this interaction, while phosphorylation by brain
extracts or by purified calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinase II

microtubule-binding activity, conversely, is stimulated after

polyamine concentration. Samples were centrifuged at low speeds to
separate bundles from unbundled actin, and the relative amounts of actin
in the pellet and supernatant were determined via gel electrophoresis,
yielding a description of the bundling transition as a function of actin
and polyamine concentrations. These experiments were carried out for two
different polyamines, spermine (tetravalent) and spermidine (trivalent).
We found that the threshold concentration of polyamine needed to bundle
actin is independent of both actin concentration and Mg2+ concentration
over a wide range in Mg2+ concentration. We also find that spermine in
F-actin bundles is essentially invisible in solution-phase proton NMR,
suggesting that it is bound so tightly to F-actin that it is immobilized.},

	abstract = {MACF (microtubule actin cross-linking factor) is a large, 608-kDa protein
that can associate with both actin microfilaments and microtubules (MTs).
Structurally, MACF can be divided into 3 domains: an N-terminal domain
that contains both a calponin type actin-binding domain and a plakin
domain; a rod domain that is composed of 23 dystrophin-like spectrin
repeats; and a C-terminal domain that includes two EF-hand calcium-binding
motifs, as well as a region that is homologous to two related proteins,
GAR22 and Gas2. We have previously demonstrated that the C-terminal domain
of MACF binds to MTs, although no homology was observed between this
domain and other known microtubule-binding proteins. In this report, we
describe the characterization of this microtubule-binding domain of MACF
by transient transfection studies and in vitro binding assays. We found
that the C-terminus of MACF contains at least two microtubule-binding
regions, a GAR domain and a domain containing glycine-serine-arginine
(GSR) repeats. In transfected cells, the GAR domain bound to and partially
stabilized MTs to depolymerization by nocodazole. The GSR-containing
domain caused MTs to form bundles that are still sensitive to
nocodazole-induced depolymerization. When present together, these two
domains acted in concert to bundle MTs and render them stable to
nocodazole treatment. Recently, a study has shown that the N-terminal half
of the plakin domain (called the M1 domain) of MACF also binds MTs. We
therefore examined the microtubule binding ability of the M1 domain in the
context of the entire plakin domain with and without the remaining
N-terminal regions of two different MACF isoforms. Interestingly, in the
presence of the surrounding sequences, the M1 domain did not bind MTs. In
addition to MACF, cDNA sequences encoding the GAR and GSR-containing
domains are also found in the partial human EST clone KIAA0728, which has
high sequence homology to the 3' end of the MACF cDNA; hence, we refer to
it as MACF2. The C-terminal domain of mouse MACF2 was cloned and
characterized. The microtubule-binding properties of MACF2 C-terminal
domain are similar to that of MACF. The GAR domain was originally found in
Gas 2 protein and here we show that it can associate with MTs in
transfected cells. Plectin and desmoplakin have GSR-containing domains at
their C-termini and we further demonstrate that the GSR-containing domain
of plectin, but not desmoplakin, can bind to MTs in vivo.},

microtubules, the actin-based cytoskeleton and possibly membrane

of exogenous vimentin. These results suggest the existence of a pool of
plectin which preferentially associates with IFs but may also be competed
for by microtubules. The association of IFs with microtubules did not show
a preference for Glu-tubulin. Nor did it depend upon the presence of MAP4
since plectin links were retained after specific immunodepletion of MAP4.
The association of IFs with stress fibers survived actin depletion by
gelsolin suggesting that myosin II minifilaments or components closely

strength is weak (Kd = 20 microM) as compared with that of the kinase (Kd

modulated by their common intermediate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
Pelleting and electron microscopic measurements have revealed that the
aldolase binding interferes with that of phosphofructokinase, although
they have distinct binding domains on microtubules. The underlying
molecular mechanism responsible for this finding is that in the solution
phase aldolase and phosphofructokinase form a bienzyme complex that does
not bind to the microtubule. The bienzyme complex formation does not
influence the catalytic activity of aldolase, however, it inhibits the
dissociation-induced inactivation of the kinase by stabilizing a
catalytically active molecular form. The present data suggest the first
experimental evidence that two sequential glycolytic enzymes do not
associate simultaneously to microtubules, but their complexation in

polymers, using experimental methods and theoretical models developed for
traditional polymers but modified for the much larger, stiffer, and
fragile biopolymers comprising the cytoskeleton. The presence of motor
proteins that move actin filaments and microtubules also creates a new
class of active materials that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium, and
unconstrained by limitations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. These
active materials create rich opportunities for experimental design and
theoretical developments. The degree to which the mechanics of live cells

nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation in human aorta endothelial
cells (HAECs) was quantified as an assay of anti-inflammatory action.
RESULTS: CSA-13 is significantly more effective than cationic
antibacterial peptides against kanamycin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and less susceptible to inactivation by DNA or F-actin. The concentration
of CSA-13 sufficient to decrease the CF sputa bacteria load by
approximately 90\% is at least 10 times lower than that at which CSA-13
formed aggregates with DNA or F-actin. Both CSA-13 and LL37 prevent
lipopolysaccharide-induced translocation of NF-kappaB in HAEC, thereby
suggesting that these antibacterial molecules might prevent systemic
inflammation caused by bacterial wall components. CONCLUSIONS:
Charge-based interactions that strongly inhibit the antibacterial activity
of host cationic antibacterial peptides present in CF sputa have
significantly less effect on molecules from the ceragenin family such as
CSA-13 due in part to their smaller net charge and distribution of this
charge over a hydrophobic scaffold. CSA molecules therefore have potential
for the treatment of chronic infections and inflammation that occur in CF
airways and other settings in which extracellular polyanions accumulate.},

filaments and monomers with human serum was studied by following the
kinetics and extent of the depolymerization of pyrene-labeled F-actin and
by analysis of serum proteins adhering to immobilized actin monomers. In
physiologic Ca2+ concentrations, the depolymerization of F-actin proceeds
in two stages: a rapid phase, attributed to direct severing of filaments
by plasma gelsolin, and a slow phase attributed to the binding of actin
monomers to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP). Without Ca2+, only the slow
phase is observed. Human serum can completely depolymerize 10 to 18
mumol/L of actin, of which approximately 5 mumol/L occurs rapidly.
Depolymerization can be accounted for by the normal serum concentrations
of gelsolin and DBP. Fibrin(ogen) and fibronectin, which bind actin in
vitro, do not contribute to the kinetics or extent of its
depolymerization. Affinity chromatography and functional assays for the
presence of gelsolin-actin complexes show that addition of G-actin to
serum results in preferential formation of actin-DBP complexes, but that
addition of F-actin to serum produces both gelsolin-actin complexes and
DBP-actin complexes. The distinctive binding of actin monomers and
polymers to these two serum proteins suggests a means by which their
coordinated actions are maximized in vivo, from the standpoint of
depolymerizing filaments and clearing monomers from the circulation.},

the addition of aminoarabinose to lipid A. The PA4773-PA4775 genes are a
second DNA-induced cluster and are required for the production of
spermidine on the outer surface, which protects the outer membrane from AP
treatment. Both modifications mask the negative surface charges and limit
membrane damage by APs. DNA-enriched biofilms or planktonic cultures have
increased antibiotic resistance phenotypes to APs and aminoglycosides.

experiments reveal that vimentin networks stiffen with increasing
concentrations of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+), showing that divalent cations act as
crosslinkers. We quantitatively describe the elastic response of vimentin
networks over five decades of applied stress using a theory that treats
the divalent cations as crosslinkers: at low stress, the behavior is
entropic in origin, and increasing stress pulls out thermal fluctuations
from single filaments, giving rise to a nonlinear response; at high
stress, enthalpic stretching of individual filaments significantly
modifies the nonlinearity. We investigate the elastic properties of
networks formed by a series of protein variants with stepwise tail
truncations and find that the last 11 amino acids of the C-terminal tail
domain mediate crosslinking by divalent ions. We determined the
single-filament persistence length, l(P) approximately 0.5 mum, and
Young's modulus, Y approximately 9 MPa; both are consistent with

biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, and an isogenic CF strain
isolated early and years later in infection. In a static reactor, P.
aeruginosa biofilm density of all strains was enhanced at 24 h in the
presence of neutrophils, with the greatest relative increase associated
with the lowest inoculum of P. aeruginosa tested. Previously,
neutrophil-induced biofilm enhancement was shown to largely result from
the incorporation of F-actin and DNA polymers into the bacterial biofilm.
This finding was advanced by the comparison of biofilm enhancement from
intact unstimulated neutrophils and from lysed or apoptotic neutrophils.
Apoptotic neutrophils, with an intact cell membrane, were unable to
contribute to biofilm enhancement, while lysed neutrophils evoked a
similar response to that of intact cells. Using F-actin and DNA as
targets, the capacity of negatively charged poly(amino acids) to disrupt,
or prevent, early biofilm formation was tested. Anionic poly(aspartic
acid) effectively prevented or disrupted biofilm formation. Combination of
poly(aspartic acid) with DNase resulted in a synergistic increase in
biofilm disruption. These results demonstrate that the presence of dying
neutrophils can facilitate the initial stages of biofilm development by
low inocula of P. aeruginosa. Neutrophil F-actin represents a potential
new therapeutic target for disruption of pathogenic biofilms.},

interleukin-8 (IL-8) mediated, neutrophil inflammatory response. Necrosing
neutrophils release DNA and actin into the airways, increasing the
viscoelasticity of airway secretions. Mucolytics aim to improve airway
clearance by reducing this viscoelasticity. DNase I reduces the
viscoelasticity of CF sputum, and a human recombinant form of this enzyme
is widely administered to patients with CF. Gelsolin, which cleaves actin
polymers, is also known to reduce CF sputum viscosity in vitro, and it has
been proposed as a future mucolytic agent. We have shown that the anionic
polymers DNA and actin bind and mask immunologic recognition of the basic
peptide IL-8 and prevent this chemokine from binding to neutrophil
receptors. Reduction of CF sputum viscosity by DNase I or gelsolin in
vitro was demonstrated to increase the proportion of free IL-8 and the
IL-8-dependent neutrophil chemotactic activity of sputum supernatants. We
hypothesize that an electrostatic interaction between polymer and
chemokine may limit the inflammatory potential of the latter, but that
this interaction may be weakened by polymer cleavage. The potential risk
of increased inflammation via this mechanism suggests a caveat should be
attendant on treatment of patients with CF with these mucolytic agents.},

information content that can be mined by genomic techniques. Because of
the association of extracellular DNA with clinical conditions marked by
cell death, dead and dying cells have been considered the origin of this
material. To investigate this process, in vitro and in vivo systems have
been used to determine the release of DNA from cells, using Jurkat T cells
as a model. Thus, in vitro, apoptotic Jurkat cells release DNA whereas
necrotic cells do not. The presence of macrophages in these cultures,
however, modifies the release process, causing release from necrotic cells
as well. In in vivo experiments in which Jurkat cells are administered to
normal mice, both apoptotic and necrotic cells give rise to DNA in the
blood in a process that requires macrophages and can be modified by
glucocorticoids. In this model, female and male mice differ in the extent
of DNA release from the administered Jurkat cells. Together, these results
indicate that, while apoptosis and necrosis can lead to a blood DNA

show how interactions between these components can be controlled. Results
indicate that mixtures of cationic and negative curvature amphiphiles
optimized for DNA binding via charge matching and curvature matching can
competitively displace bound tobramycin from DNA and thereby drastically
suppress tobramycin-DNA binding and resultant antimicrobial inactivation.
Growth inhibition assays confirm the increased activity of tobramycin in
the presence of DNA with the addition of the amphiphiles. These results

complementarily to each other, resulting in electrostatic attraction of
the surfaces. The magnitude of this attraction depends solely on the
surface charge density and the solution dielectric constant, while its
range is defined by the size of the planar correlation hole around each

planar thermal motion of the ions. The theory enables construction of a

Although it has been well established that like-charged macromolecules can
aggregate under the influence of oppositely charged condensing agents, the
specific conditions for the stability of such aggregates can only be
determined empirically. We examine these conditions, which involve an
interplay of electrostatic and osmotic effects, by using a well defined
model system composed of F-actin, an anionic rod-like polyelectrolyte, and
lysozyme, a cationic globular protein with a charge that can be
genetically modified. The structure and stability of actin-lysozyme
complexes for different lysozyme charge mutants and salt concentrations
are examined by using synchrotron x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics
simulations. We provide evidence that supports a structural transition
from columnar arrangements of F-actin held together by arrays of lysozyme
at the threefold interstitial sites of the actin sublattice to marginally
stable complexes in which lysozyme resides at twofold bridging sites
between actin. The reduced stability arises from strongly reduced
partitioning of salt between the complex and the surrounding solution.
Changes in the stability of actin-lysozyme complexes are of biomedical
interest because their formation has been reported to contribute to the
persistence of airway infections in cystic fibrosis by sequestering
antimicrobials such as lysozyme. We present x-ray microscopy results that
argue for the existence of actin-lysozyme complexes in cystic fibrosis
sputum and demonstrate that, for a wide range of salt conditions,
charge-reduced lysozyme is not sequestered in ordered complexes while

infection demonstrated that anionic biopolymers accumulate to high

correlates with decreased endogenous lysozyme activity. To develop
antibacterial enzymes designed specifically to be used as antimicrobial

lysozyme (hLYS) was remodeled by protein engineering. A novel,
high-throughput screen was implemented to functionally interrogate
combinatorial libraries of charge-engineered hLYS proteins, and variants
with improved bactericidal activity were isolated and characterized in
detail. These studies illustrate a general mechanism by which polyanions
inhibit lysozyme function, and they are the first direct demonstration
that decreasing hLYS's net cationic character improves its antibacterial
activity in the presence of disease-associated biopolymers. In addition to
avoiding electrostatic sequestration, at least one charge-engineered
variant also kills bacteria more rapidly in the absence of inhibitory
biopolymers; this observation supports a novel hypothesis that tuning the

previously shown to induce actin bundling and was thus hypothesized to
contribute to the pathogenicity of this disease. In this work,
interactions between actin and the cationic LL-37 were studied by optical,
proteolytic and surface plasmon resonance methods and compared to those
obtained with scrambled LL-37 and with the cationic protein lysozyme. We
show that LL-37 binds strongly to CaATP-G-actin while scrambled LL-37 does
not. While LL-37, at superstoichiometric LL-37/actin concentrations
polymerizes MgATP-G-actin, at lower non-polymerizing concentrations LL-37
inhibits actin polymerization by MgCl(2) or NaCl. LL-37 bundles Mg-F-actin
filaments both at low and physiological ionic strength when in equimolar
or higher concentrations than those of actin. The LL-37 induced bundles
are significantly less sensitive to increase in ionic strength than those
induced by scrambled LL-37 and lysozyme. LL-37 in concentrations lower
than those needed for actin polymerization or bundling, accelerates
cleavage of both monomer and polymer actin by subtilisin. Our results
indicate that the LL-37-actin interaction is partially electrostatic and
partially hydrophobic and that a specific actin binding sequence in the

often isolated from biofilms. We grew P. aeruginosa biofilms in glass flow

emergence of plaque-forming Pf1-like filamentous phage (designated Pf4)
from the biofilm. Because several recent studies have shown that
bacteriophage genes are among the most highly upregulated groups of genes

SCV formation during P. aeruginosa biofilm development. We carried out
immunoelectron microscopy using anti-Pf4 antibodies and observed that SCV
cells, but not parental-type cells, exhibited high densities of Pf4
filaments on the cell surface and that these filaments were often tightly
interwoven into complex latticeworks surrounding the cells. Moreover,
infection of P. aeruginosa planktonic cultures with Pf4 caused the
emergence of SCVs within the culture. These SCVs exhibited enhanced

there is a 2 A ion-exclusion region (epsilon r = 80) adjacent to the polar

describing the adsorption of charged molecules to surfaces. The ability of
this equation to describe the adsorption of divalent cations to membranes
containing brain phosphatidylserine (PS) was tested in the following
manner. Charge reversal measurements were first made to determine the
intrinsic 1:1 association constants of the divalent cations with the
anionic PS molecules: when the net charge of a PS vesicle is zero one-half
of the available sites are occupied by divalent cations. The intrinsic
association constant, therefore, is equal to the reciprocal of the
divalent cation concentration at which the mobility of a PS vesicle
reverses sign. The Stern equation with this association constant is
capable of accurately describing both the zeta potential data obtained
with PS vesicles at other concentrations of the divalent cations and the
data obtained with with vesicles formed from mixtures of PS and
zwitterionic phospholipids. Independent measurements of the number of ions
adsorbed to sonicated PS vesicles were made with a calcium-sensitive
electrode. The results agreed with the zeta potential results obtained
with multilamellar vesicles. When membranes are formed at 20 degrees C in
0.1 M NaCl, the intrinsic 1:1 association constants of Ni, Co, Mn, Ba, Sr,

	abstract = {The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key representative
of tyrosine kinase receptors, ubiquitous actors in cell signaling,
proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Although the receptor is
well-studied, a central issue remains: How does the compositional
diversity and functional diversity of the surrounding membrane modulate
receptor function? Reconstituting human EGFR into proteoliposomes of
well-defined and controlled lipid compositions represents a minimal
synthetic approach to systematically address this question. We show that
lipid composition has little effect on ligand-binding properties of the
EGFR but rather exerts a profound regulatory effect on kinase domain
activation. Here, the ganglioside GM3 but not other related lipids
strongly inhibited the autophosphorylation of the EGFR kinase domain. This
inhibitory action of GM3 was only seen in liposomes compositionally poised
to phase separate into coexisting liquid domains. The inhibition by GM3
was released by either removing the neuraminic acid of the GM3 headgroup
or by mutating a membrane proximal lysine of EGFR (K642G). Our results
demonstrate that GM3 exhibits the potential to regulate the allosteric
structural transition from inactive to a signaling EGFR dimer, by
preventing the autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain in
response to ligand binding.},

for biological applications in the AMBER program in the context of the

Trotter factorization of the Liouville operator based on the
position-Verlet scheme to Newtonian and Langevin dynamics. Following a
brief review of the MTS and PME algorithms, we discuss performance speedup
and the force balancing involved to maximize accuracy, maintain long-time
stability, and accelerate computational times. Compared to prior MTS
efforts in the context of the AMBER program, advances are possible by
optimizing PME parameters for MTS applications and by using the
position-Verlet, rather than velocity-Verlet, scheme for the inner loop.
Moreover, ideas from the Langevin/MTS algorithm LN are applied to
Newtonian formulations here. The algorithm?s performance is optimized and
tested on water, solvated DNA, and solvated protein systems. We find CPU
speedup ratios of over 3 for Newtonian formulations when compared to a 1
fs single-step Verlet algorithm using outer time steps of 6 fs in a
three-class splitting scheme; accurate conservation of energies is
demonstrated over simulations of length several hundred ps. With modest
Langevin forces, we obtain stable trajectories for outer time steps up to
12 fs and corresponding speedup ratios approaching 5. We end by suggesting
that modified Ewald formulations, using tailored alternatives to the
Gaussian screening functions for the Coulombic terms, may allow larger
time steps and thus further speedups for both Newtonian and Langevin
protocols; such developments are reported separately.},

knowledge about the physiological roles of the sweet taste receptor in
oral and extraoral tissues. RECENT FINDINGS: The expression of a
functional sweet taste receptor has been reported in numerous
extragustatory tissues, including the gut, pancreas, bladder, brain and,
more recently, bone and adipose tissues. In the gut, this receptor has
been suggested to be involved in luminal glucose sensing, the release of
some satiety hormones, the expression of glucose transporters, and the
maintenance of glucose homeostasis. More recently, the sweet taste
receptor was proposed to regulate adipogenesis and bone biology. SUMMARY:
The perception of sweet taste is mediated by the T1R2/T1R3 receptor, which
is expressed in the oral cavity, wherein it provides input on the caloric
and macronutrient contents of ingested food. This receptor recognizes all
the chemically diverse compounds perceived as sweet by human beings,
including natural sugars and sweeteners. Importantly, the expression of a
functional sweet taste receptor has been reported in numerous
extragustatory tissues, wherein it has been proposed to regulate metabolic
processes. This newly recognized role of the sweet taste receptor makes
this receptor a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of
obesity and related metabolic dysfunctions, such as diabetes and
hyperlipidemia.},

shown that syntaxin-1A occurs in clusters that are different from lipid

reconstituted syntaxin-1A into lipid model membranes, and we show that
syntaxin cluster formation depends on cholesterol in a lipid system that
lacks sphingomyelin and therefore does not form liquid-ordered phases that
are commonly believed to represent lipid rafts in cell membranes. Rather,
the cholesterol-induced clustering of syntaxin is found to be reversed by
as little as 1-5 mol \% of the regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P(2)), and PI-4,5-P(2) is shown to bind

(PtdIns(4,5)P(2)), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
(PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)) that are present in the PM play important roles for
their specific PM recruitment. To systematically analyze how these lipids
mediate PM targeting of cellular proteins, we performed biophysical,
computational, and cell studies of the Ca(2+)-dependent C2 domain of
protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) that is known to bind PS and
phosphoinositides. In vitro membrane binding measurements by surface
plasmon resonance analysis show that PKCalpha-C2 nonspecifically binds
phosphoinositides, including PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), but
that PS and Ca(2+) binding is prerequisite for productive phosphoinositide
binding. PtdIns(4,5)P(2) or PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) augments the Ca(2+)- and
PS-dependent membrane binding of PKCalpha-C2 by slowing its membrane
dissociation. Molecular dynamics simulations also support that
Ca(2+)-dependent PS binding is essential for membrane interactions of
PKCalpha-C2. PtdIns(4,5)P(2) alone cannot drive the membrane attachment of
the domain but further stabilizes the Ca(2+)- and PS-dependent membrane
binding. When the fluorescence protein-tagged PKCalpha-C2 was expressed in
NIH-3T3 cells, mutations of phosphoinositide-binding residues or depletion
of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and/or PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) from PM did not significantly
affect the PM association of the domain but accelerated its dissociation
from PM. Also, local synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) or PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) at
the PM slowed membrane dissociation of PKCalpha-C2. Collectively, these
studies show that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) augment the
Ca(2+)- and PS-dependent membrane binding of PKCalpha-C2 by elongating the
membrane residence of the domain but cannot drive the PM recruitment of
PKCalpha-C2. These studies also suggest that effective PM recruitment of
many cellular proteins may require synergistic actions of PS and
phosphoinositides.},

paper, we investigate the interaction between PIP₂ and ezrin in vitro

results obtained with full-length ezrin to those obtained with an ezrin
mutant, which was previously found not to be localized at the cell
membrane, and with the N-terminal membrane binding domain (FERM domain) of
ezrin. We show that PIP₂ induced a conformational change in full-length
ezrin. PIP₂ was also found to induce, in vitro, the formation of oligomers
of wild-type ezrin, but not of mutant ezrin. These oligomers had
previously been observed in vivo, but their role is yet to be clarified.

elastic material, we compute the intramembrane stresses and strains
generated by the embedded inclusions, determine the resulting membrane
shapes, and the accumulated elastic energy. We characterize the ability of
an inclusion to bend membranes by an effective spontaneous curvature, and
show that shallow rodlike inclusions are more effective in membrane
shaping than are lipids having a high propensity for curvature. Our
computations provide experimentally testable predictions on the protein
amounts needed to generate intracellular membrane shapes for various
insertion depths and membrane thicknesses. We also predict that the
ability of N-BAR domains to produce membrane tubules in vivo can be
ascribed solely to insertion of their amphipathic helices.},

fundamental processes in eukaryotic cells. Dozens of actin-binding
proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of actin filament
organization or turnover and many of these are stimulus-response
regulators of phospholipid signaling. One of these proteins is the
heterodimeric actin-capping protein (CP) which binds the barbed end of
actin filaments with high affinity and inhibits both addition and loss of
actin monomers at this end. The ability of CP to bind filaments is
regulated by signaling phospholipids, which inhibit the activity of CP;
however, the exact mechanism of this regulation and the residues on CP

different methods of computational biology such as homology modeling,
molecular docking and coarse-grained molecular dynamics, we uncovered

animal CP. In particular, we identified differences in the binding of
membrane lipids by animal and plant CP, explaining previously published

talin head domain contains four sub-domains (F0, F1, F2 and F3) with a

novel V-shaped conformation which optimizes its interactions with the

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the best
characterised member of the receptor tyrosine kinases, which play an
important role in signalling across mammalian cell membranes. The EGFR
juxtamembrane (JM) domain is involved in the mechanism of activation of
the receptor, interacting with the anionic lipid phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the intracellular leaflet of the cell membrane.
METHODS: Multiscale MD simulations were used to characterize PIP2-JM
interactions. Simulations of the transmembrane helix plus JM region
(TM-JM) dimer (PDB:2M20) in both PIP2-containing and PIP2-depleted lipid
bilayer membranes revealed the interactions of the JM with PIP2 and other
lipids. RESULTS: PIP2 forms strong interactions with the basic residues in
the R645-R647 motif of the JM domain resulting in clustering of PIP2
around the protein. This association of PIP2 and the JM domain aids
stabilization of JM-A dimer away from the membrane. Mutation
(R645N/R646N/R647N) or PIP2-depletion results in deformation of the JM-A
dimer and changes in JM-membrane interactions. CONCLUSIONS: These
simulations support the proposal that the positively charged residues at
the start of the JM-A domain stabilize the JM-A helices in an orientation
away from the membrane surface through binding to PIP2, thus promoting a
conformation corresponding to an asymmetric (i.e. activated) kinase.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study indicates that MD simulations may be used
to characterise JM/lipid interactions, thus helping to define their role
in the mechanisms of receptor tyrosine kinases. This article is part of a

major mechanism of regulation of FAK activity is an intramolecular

FERM domains. Upon cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, FAK is being
translocated toward focal adhesion sites and activated. Interactions of
FAK with phosphoinositide phosphatidylinsositol-4,5-bis-phosphate (PIP₂)
are required to activate FAK. However, the molecular mechanism of the
activation remains poorly understood. Recent fluorescence resonance energy
transfer experiments revealed a closure of the FERM-kinase interface upon
ATP binding, which is reversed upon additional binding of PIP₂. Here, we
addressed the allosteric regulation of FAK by performing all-atom
molecular-dynamics simulations of a FAK fragment containing the catalytic
and FERM domains, and comparing the dynamics in the absence or presence of
ATP and PIP₂. As a major conformational change, we observe a closing and
opening motion upon ATP and additional PIP₂ binding, respectively, in good
agreement with the fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments. To
reveal how the binding of the regulatory PIP₂ to the FERM F2 lobe is
transduced to the very distant F1/N-lobe interface, we employed force
distribution analysis. We identified a network of mainly charged
residue-residue interactions spanning from the PIP₂ binding site to the
distant interface between the kinase and FERM domains, comprising
candidate residues for mutagenesis to validate the predicted mechanism of

exocyst is composed of eight subunits - Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15,
Exo84 and two membrane-targeting landmark subunits Sec3 and Exo70, which
have been described to directly interact with phosphatidylinositol
(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) of the plasma membrane. In this work, we
utilized coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate
structural details of the interaction of yeast Sec3p and Exo70p with lipid
bilayers containing PIP2. We found that PIP2 is coordinated by the
positively charged pocket of N-terminal part of Sec3p, which folds into
unique Pleckstrin homology domain. Conversely, Exo70p interacts with the
lipid bilayer by several binding sites distributed along the structure of
this exocyst subunit. Moreover, we observed that the interaction of Exo70p
with the membrane causes clustering of PIP2 in the adjacent leaflet. We
further revealed that PIP2 is required for the correct positioning of
small GTPase Rho1p, a direct Sec3p interactor, prior to the formation of
the functional Rho1p-exocyst-membrane assembly. Our results show the
critical importance of the plasma membrane pool of PIP2 for the exocyst

raft membranes, but in several instances exited the raft containing GM1.
Aβ(40) interacted with GM1 largely through hydrogen bonding, producing
configurations containing β-strands with C-termini that, in some cases,
exited the membrane and became exposed to solvent. These observations
provide insight into the release of Aβ from the membrane, a previously

	abstract = {The dopamine transporter (DAT) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the
family of neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS). Members of the NSS are
responsible for the clearance of neurotransmitters from the synaptic
cleft, and for their translocation back into the presynaptic nerve
terminal. The DAT contains long intracellular N- and C-terminal domains
that are strongly implicated in the transporter function. The N-terminus
(N-term), in particular, regulates the reverse transport (efflux) of the
substrate through DAT. Currently, the molecular mechanisms of the efflux
remain elusive in large part due to lack of structural information on the
N-terminal segment. Here we report a computational model of the N-term of
the human DAT (hDAT), obtained through an ab initio structure prediction,
in combination with extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations in the context of a lipid membrane. Our analysis reveals that
whereas the N-term is a highly dynamic domain, it contains secondary
structure elements that remain stable in the long MD trajectories of
interactions with the bilayer (totaling {\textgreater}2.2 μs). Combining MD simulations
with continuum mean-field modeling we found that the N-term engages with
lipid membranes through electrostatic interactions with the charged lipids
PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Biphosphate) or PS (phosphatidylserine)
that are present in these bilayers. We identify specific motifs along the
N-term implicated in such interactions and show that differential modes of
N-term/membrane association result in differential positioning of the
structured segments on the membrane surface. These results will inform
future structure-based studies that will elucidate the mechanistic role of
the N-term in DAT function.},

inactive conformational states to regulate a variety of cell signaling
pathways. Somatic mutations in K-Ras are linked to 15-20\% of all human
tumors. K-Ras attaches to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane via a
farnesylated polybasic domain; however, the structural details of the
complex remain poorly understood. Based on extensive (7.5 μs total)
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations here we show that oncogenic
mutant K-Ras interacts with a negatively charged lipid bilayer membrane in
multiple orientations. Of these, two highly populated orientations account
for ∼54\% of the conformers whose catalytic domain directly interacts with
the bilayer. In one of these orientation states, membrane binding involves
helices 3 and 4 of the catalytic domain in addition to the farnesyl and
polybasic motifs. In the other orientation, β-strands 1-3 and helix 2 on
the opposite face of the catalytic domain contribute to membrane binding.
Flexibility of the linker region was found to be important for the
reorientation. The biological significance of these observations was
evaluated by initial experiments in cells overexpressing mutant K-Ras as
well as by an analysis of Ras-effector complex structures. The results
suggest that only one of the two major orientation states is capable of
effector binding. We propose that the different modes of membrane binding
may be exploited in structure-based drug design efforts for cancer
therapy.},

depend strongly on force field parameters, making experimental
verification of the simulations obligatory, and (b) slow orientational and
conformational fluctuations mean that much longer sampling timescales
(multi-μs) are needed if quantitative agreement between simulation
averages and experimental data is to be achieved. This article is part of

protein sequences is a critical challenge to identifying membrane proteins

sequence statistics have had moderate success, a complete understanding of
the energetic factors that drive the insertion of membrane proteins is
essential to thoroughly meeting this challenge. In the last few years,
numerous attempts to define a free-energy scale for amino-acid insertion
have been made, yet disagreement between most experimental and theoretical
scales persists. However, for a recently resolved water-to-bilayer scale,
it is found that molecular dynamics simulations that carefully mimic the
conditions of the experiment can reproduce experimental free energies,
even when using the same force field as previous computational studies
that were cited as evidence of this disagreement. Therefore, it is
suggested that experimental and simulation-based scales can both be
accurate and that discrepancies stem from disparities in the microscopic
processes being considered rather than methodological errors. Furthermore,
these disparities make the development of a single universally applicable
membrane-insertion free energy scale difficult.},

by analyses of the crystal structures of small molecules containing this
cation that are found in the Cambridge Structural Database, protein
crystal structures in the Protein Databank, and by ab initio molecular
orbital calculations on hydrated structures of the form Ca[H2O]n2+·mH2O,
in which there are n water molecules in the first coordination shell and m
water molecules in the second coordination shell (hydrogen bonded to water
molecules in the first shell). Calcium ions in crystal structures
generally bind to oxygen atoms in ligands (rather than any other element),
and their preferred coordination numbers range from 6 to 8. In protein
crystal structures the tendency of calcium to bind water molecules is less
than for magnesium (1.5 versus 2.2 water molecules on the average per
metal ion site, respectively). The ratio of bidentate to monodentate
binding of calcium ions to carboxylate groups is similar for small
molecules and protein structures in that no bidentate binding occurs if
the coordination number of Ca2+ is 6, but its occurrence rises to near 20\%
for coordination numbers 7 and 8. Complexes of the form Ca[H2O]52+·H2O and
Ca[H2O]42+·2H2O were found (by ab initio molecular orbital calculations in
vacuo) to be significantly higher in energy than Ca[H2O]62+ (by 8.2 and
15.0 kcal/mol, respectively). For Ca2+ surrounded by seven or eight water
molecules, the differences in energy between Ca[H2O]62+·H2O and Ca[H2O]72+
and among Ca[H2O]62+·2H2O, Ca[H2O]72+·H2O, and Ca[H2O]82+ are extremely
small when diffuse functions are included in the basis set. Thus, the net
energy penalty for changing the number of water molecules in the first
coordination shell between 6 and 8 is small. Molecular orbital
calculations also indicate that the effect of a calcium ion on the H−O−H
angle to bound water is less (at normal coordination numbers) than that of
magnesium, zinc, or beryllium.},

	abstract = {A coarse-grained (CG) procedure that incorporates the information obtained
from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is presented and applied
to actin filaments (F-actin). This procedure matches the averaged values
and fluctuations of the effective internal coordinates that are used to
define a CG model to the values extracted from atomistic MD simulations.
The fluctuations of effective internal coordinates in a CG model are
computed via normal-mode analysis (NMA), and the computed fluctuations are
matched with the atomistic MD results in a self-consistent manner. Each
actin monomer (G-actin) is coarse-grained into four sites, and each site
corresponds to one of the subdomains of G-actin. The potential energy of a
CG G-actin contains three bonds, two angles, and one dihedral angle;
effective harmonic bonds are used to describe the intermonomer
interactions in a CG F-actin. The persistence length of a CG F-actin was
found to be sensitive to the cut-off distance of assigning intermonomer
bonds. Effective harmonic bonds for a monomer with its third nearest
neighboring monomers are found to be necessary to reproduce the values of
persistence length obtained from all-atom MD simulations. Compared to the
elastic network model, incorporating the information of internal
coordinate fluctuations enhances the accuracy and robustness for a CG
model to describe the shapes of low-frequency vibrational modes. Combining
the fluctuation-matching CG procedure and NMA, the achievable time- and
length scales of modeling actin filaments can be greatly enhanced. In
particular, a method is described to compute the force-extension curve
using the CG model developed in this work and NMA. It was found that
F-actin is easily buckled under compressive deformation, and a writhing
mode is developed as a result. In addition to the bending and twisting
modes, this novel writhing mode of F-actin could also play important roles
in the interactions of F-actin with actin-binding proteins and in the
force-generation process via polymerization.},

dissociation and thus also electrostatic repulsion. This leads to a higher
surface pressure, a lower transition temperature and a smaller size of
solid domains observed in the liquid/solid coexistence range of

improvement in simulation speed over a single CPU core. We show that free
energy values calculated using this platform agree with the results of
Tinker simulations for the hydration of organic compounds and binding of
host-guest systems within the statistical errors. In addition to absolute
binding, we designed a relative alchemical approach for computing relative
binding affinities of ligands to the same host, where a special path was
applied to avoid numerical instability due to polarization between the
different ligands that bind to the same site. This scheme is general and
does not require ligands to have similar scaffolds. We show that relative
hydration and binding free energy calculated using this approach match
those computed from the absolute free energy approach. © 2017 Wiley

comprehensive use of calorimetric host-guest binding data, along with

	abstract = {The introduction in the clinic of anti-complement agents represented a
major achievement which gave to physicians a novel etiologic treatment for
different human diseases. Indeed, the first anti-complement agent
eculizumab has changed the treatment paradigm of paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria (PNH), dramatically impacting its severe clinical course.
In addition, eculizumab is the first agent approved for atypical Hemolytic
Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), a life-threatening inherited thrombotic
microangiopathy. Nevertheless, such remarkable milestone in medicine has
brought to the fore additional challenges for the scientific community.
Indeed, the list of complement-mediated anemias is not limited to PNH and
aHUS, and other human diseases can be considered for anti-complement
treatment. They include other thrombotic microangiopathies, as well as
some antibody-mediated hemolytic anemias. Furthermore, more than ten years
of experience with eculizumab led to a better understanding of the
individual steps of the complement cascade involved in the pathophysiology
of different human diseases. Based on this, new unmet clinical needs are
emerging; a number of different strategies are currently under development
to improve current anti-complement treatment, trying to address these
specific clinical needs. They include: (i) alternative anti-C5 agents,
which may improve the heaviness of eculizumab treatment; (ii)
broad-spectrum anti-C3 agents, which may improve the efficacy of anti-C5
treatment by intercepting the complement cascade upstream (i.e.,
preventing C3-mediated extravascular hemolysis in PNH); (iii) targeted
inhibitors of selective complement activating pathways, which may prevent
early pathogenic events of specific human diseases (e.g., anti-classical
pathway for antibody-mediated anemias, or anti-alternative pathway for PNH
and aHUS). Here we briefly summarize the status of art of current and
future complement inhibition for different complement-mediated anemias,

in more tasks than fighting infections, but has important roles in other
immune surveillance and housekeeping functions. If the balance between
complement activation and regulation is out of tune, however, complement
can quickly turn against the host and contribute to adverse processes that
result in various clinical conditions. Whereas clinical awareness was
initially focused on complement deficiencies, excessive activation and
insufficient regulation are frequently the dominant factors in
complement-related disorders. The individual complement profile of a
patient often determines the course and severity of the disease, and the
pathophysiological involvement of complement may be highly diverse. As a
consequence, complement assays have evolved as essential tools not only in
initial diagnosis but also for following disease progression and for
monitoring complement-targeted therapies, which become increasingly
available in routine clinical use. We herein review the current state of
complement-directed drug candidates in clinical evaluation and provide an
overview of extended indications considered for the FDA-approved inhibitor
eculizumab. Furthermore we review the literature describing cases reports
and case series where eculizumab has been used "off-label". Finally, we
give a summary of the currently available tests to measure complement
profiles and discuss their suitability in diagnostics and treatment
monitoring. With complement finally entering the clinical arena, there are
intriguing opportunities for treating complement-mediated diseases.
However, this progress also requires a new awareness about complement
pathophysiology, adequate diagnostic tools and suitable treatment options
among clinicians treating patients with such disorders.},

typically confers protection from microbial intruders and accumulating
debris. In many clinical situations, however, the defensive functions of
complement can turn against host cells and induce or exacerbate immune,
inflammatory, and degenerative conditions. Although the value of
inhibiting complement in a therapeutic context has long been recognized,
bringing complement-targeted drugs into clinical use has proved
challenging. This important milestone was finally reached a decade ago,
yet the clinical availability of complement inhibitors has remained
limited. Still, the positive long-term experience with complement drugs
and their proven effectiveness in various diseases has reinvigorated
interest and confidence in this approach. Indeed, a broad variety of
clinical candidates that act at almost any level of the complement
activation cascade are currently in clinical development, with several of
them being evaluated in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. With antibody-related
drugs dominating the panel of clinical candidates, the emergence of novel
small-molecule, peptide, protein, and oligonucleotide-based inhibitors
offers new options for drug targeting and administration. Whereas all the
currently approved and many of the proposed indications for
complement-targeted inhibitors belong to the rare disease spectrum, these
drugs are increasingly being evaluated for more prevalent conditions.
Fortunately, the growing experience from preclinical and clinical use of
therapeutic complement inhibitors has enabled a more evidence-based
assessment of suitable targets and rewarding indications as well as
related technical and safety considerations. This review highlights recent
concepts and developments in complement-targeted drug discovery, provides
an overview of current and emerging treatment options, and discusses the

has a relapsing course, but none of the children reached ESRD at 1 yr.
Half of patients with IF mutation had a rapid evolution to ESRD, and half

be sufficient for exclusive autonomous disrotary motion of two appended

HIV-protease inhibitor. The results suggest that sensitivity analysis is a
fast and robust method for guiding charge changes in both a rigid and a
flexible ligand, although its accuracy is limited by the fact that it
represents a linear approximation. The more complete quadratic analysis
provided by charge-optimization produces unexpected results when the
ligand is considered to be flexible. For example, it can yield atomic
charges which powerfully stabilize the bound conformation of the ligand
relative to the conformation assumed for the free state, thus markedly
destabilizing the assumed free conformation. Such results are traceable to
the fact that the energy matrix possesses negative eigenvalues. However,
optimizing charges under the assumption that the ligand does not change
conformation upon binding leads to a set of charges that robustly improve
affinity, even when the free conformation is later allowed to vary. Thus,
both sensitivity analysis and charge-optimization appear to be useful

partitioning of cellular membranes into lateral subdivision should be

compartmentalization and the molecular mechanisms by which they are
functionalized remain nearly as mysterious today as they were two decades
ago. Herein, we review recent literature on this topic with a specific

function of the complex lipidome of mammalian cells with respect to
membrane organization? (3) what are the mechanisms that drive raft

be controlled by introducing steric "speed bumps" or electrostatically

for example, light, external modulation of the chemical and/or physical

used to favour some, and suppress other, transitions so that completion of
a mechanical cycle in a direction in which work is done on the environment

a direction in which work is absorbed from the environment. In this

The compression and decompression strokes involving the binding processes
of the (Z)- and (E)-isomers of this engine with 1-adamantanol (AD) have
been elucidated by determining the underlying potentials of mean force
(PMFs). The difference in the binding-free energies, considered as the

kcal/mol, in remarkable agreement with the experimentally measured
quantity. Partitioning the PMFs into physically meaningful free-energy
components suggests that the two binding processes are primarily
controlled by the favorable inclusion of AD by the β-CD. The work
generated by the engine is harnessed to push the alkyl moiety from the
hydrophobic cavity of the CD to water, to modify a dihedral angle by a
twisting motion about the C–Cα bond, and to increase the tilt angle
between the mean plane of the sugar unit, which connects the amide moiety,
and the mean plane of the CD. By deciphering the intricate mechanism

motion, and have inspired the design of artificial systems such as DNA

controlled movement of single molecules along a surface has been reported,
the molecules in these examples act as passive elements that either
diffuse along a preferential direction with equal probability for forward
and backward movement or are dragged by an STM tip. Here we present a
molecule with four functional units--our previously reported rotary
motors--that undergo continuous and defined conformational changes upon
sequential electronic and vibrational excitation. Scanning tunnelling
microscopy confirms that activation of the conformational changes of the
rotors through inelastic electron tunnelling propels the molecule
unidirectionally across a Cu(111) surface. The system can be adapted to
follow either linear or random surface trajectories or to remain
stationary, by tuning the chirality of the individual motor units. Our

graphene jet nanomotor has been demonstrated for the first time. Graphite
particles with pyramidal-like morphologies were fabricated by the creation
of suitable defects in wide high-purity graphite flakes followed by a
severe sonication. The particles were able to be self-exfoliated in water
after Na intercalation between the graphene constituents. The
self-exfoliation resulted in jet ejection of graphene flakes from the end
of the swimmers (with speeds as high as ∼7000 m/s), producing a driving
force (at least ∼0.7 L (pN) where L (μm) is swimmer size) and consequently
the motion of the swimmer (with average speed of ∼17-40 μm/s). The jet
ejection of the graphene flakes was assigned to the explosion of H2
nanobubbles produced between the Na intercalated flakes. The direction of
motion of the swimmers equipped with TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) can be
controlled by applying a magnetic field in the presence of UV irradiation
(higher UV intensity, lower radius of rotation). In fact, the negative
surface charge of the graphene flakes of the swimmers increased by UV
irradiation due to transferring the photoexcited electrons of TiO2 NPs
into the flakes. Because of higher production of H2 nanobubbles under UV
irradiation, the speed of swimmers exposed to UV light significantly
increased. In contrast, UV irradiation with various intensities could not
affect total distance traversed by the self-exfoliated swimmers having the
same initial sizes. These confirmed the mass ejection mechanism for motion
of the swimmers. The self-exfoliation of swimmers (and so their motion)
occurred only in water (and not, e.g., in organic solutions). Such
swimmers promise the design of remote controllable nanovehicles with the
capability of initiating and/or improving their operations in response to

reported. The trans-1 and cis-2 isomers can each adapt three different
conformations, (P,P) and (M,M) (an enantiomeric pair) and an achiral (P,M)

The conformations and heats of formation of (M,M)-(E)-1, (P,M)-(E)-1,
(M,M)-(Z)-2, and (P,M)-(Z)-2 isomers were determined by MOPAC AM1
calculations. The racemization process for both the trans- and cis-

inversions of the cyclohexenyl ring; (M,M) ↔ (P,M) ↔ (P,P). The (M,M) →

path calculations, providing the molecular structure and the activation

racemization process, the activation enthalpy (ΔH⧧) was calculated as 23.9

motor consisting of only 28 carbon and 24 hydrogen atoms. The concept of
controlling directionality of rotary movement at the molecular level by
introduction of a stereogenic center next to the central olefinic bond of
a sterically overcrowded alkene does not only hold for molecular motors
with six-membered rings, but is also applicable to achieve the
unidirectional movement for molecular motors having five-membered rings.
Although X-ray analyses show that the five-membered rings in the cis- and
trans-isomer of the new molecular motor are nearly flat, the energy
differences between the (pseudo-)diaxial and (pseudo-)diequatorial
conformations of the methyl substituents in both isomers are still large
enough to direct the rotation of one-half of the molecule with respect to
the other half in a clockwise fashion. The full rotary cycle comprises
four consecutive steps: two photochemical isomerizations each followed by
a thermal helix inversion. Both photochemical cis-trans isomerizations
proceed with a preference for the unstable diequatorial isomers over the
stable diaxial isomers. The thermal barriers for helix inversion of this
motor molecule have decreased dramatically compared to its six-membered
ring analogue, the half-life of the fastest step being only 18 s at room
temperature.},

alkenes represent a broad class of compounds for which photochemical
rearrangements lead to large scale motion of one part of the molecule with
respect to another. It is this motion/change in molecular shape that is
employed in many of their applications. A key group in this class are the
molecular rotary motors that undergo unidirectional light-driven rotation
about a double bond through a series of photochemical and thermal steps.
In the present contribution we report a combined quantum chemical and
molecular dynamics study of the mechanism of the rotational cycle of the
fluorene-based molecular rotary motor
9-(2,4,7-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-9H-fluorene (1). The
potential energy surfaces of the ground and excited singlet states of 1
were calculated, and it was found that conical intersections play a
central role in the mechanism of photo conversion between the stable
conformer of 1 and its metastable conformer. Molecular dynamics
simulations indicate that the average lifetime of the fluorene motor in
the excited state is 1.40 +/- 0.10 ps when starting from the stable
conformer, which increases to 1.77 +/- 0.13 ps for the reverse
photoisomerization. These simulations indicate that the quantum yield of
photoisomerization of the stable conformer is 0.92, whereas it is only
0.40 for the reverse photoisomerization. For the first time, a theoretical
understanding of the experimentally observed photostationary state of 1 is
reported that provides a detailed picture of the photoisomerization
dynamics in overcrowded alkene-based molecular motor 1. The analysis of
the electronic structure of the fluorene molecular motor holds
considerable implications for the design of molecular motors. Importantly,
the role of pyramidalization and conical intersections offer new insight
into the factors that dominate the photostationary state achieved in these
systems.},

proved pivotal in controlling the speed of rotation, where a smaller size
results in lower barriers. The presence of a pseudo-asymmetric carbon
center provides the motor with unidirectionality. Tuning of the steric
effects of the substituents at the bridgehead allows for the precise
control of the direction of disrotary motion, illustrated by the design of
two motors which show opposite rotation with respect to a methyl
substituent. A third-generation molecular motor with the potential to be
the fastest based on overcrowded alkenes to date was used to visualize the
equal rate of rotation of both its rotor units. The autonomous rotational
behavior perfectly followed the predicted model, setting the stage for
more advanced motors for functional dynamic systems.},

(E-Z) isomerization are promising tools for the conversion of light energy
to mechanical motion in nanoscale molecular machines. Considerable
progress has been made in optimizing the frequency of ground-state
rotation, but less attention has been focused on excited-state processes.
Here the excited-state dynamics of a molecular motor with electron donor
and acceptor substituents located to modify the excited-state reaction
coordinate, without altering its stereochemistry, are studied. The
substituents are shown to modify the photochemical yield of the
isomerization without altering the motor frequency. By combining 50 fs
resolution time-resolved fluorescence with ultrafast transient absorption
spectroscopy the underlying excited-state dynamics are characterized. The
Franck-Condon excited state relaxes in a few hundred femtoseconds to
populate a lower energy dark state by a pathway that utilizes a volume
conserving structural change. This is assigned to pyramidalization at a
carbon atom of the isomerizing bridging double bond. The structure and
energy of the dark state thus reached are a function of the substituent,
with electron-withdrawing groups yielding a lower energy longer lived dark
state. The dark state is coupled to the Franck-Condon state and decays on
a picosecond time scale via a coordinate that is sensitive to solvent
friction, such as rotation about the bridging bond. Neither subpicosecond
nor picosecond dynamics are sensitive to solvent polarity, suggesting that
intramolecular charge transfer and solvation are not key driving forces
for the rate of the reaction. Instead steric factors and medium friction
determine the reaction pathway, with the sterically remote substitution
primarily influencing the energetics. Thus, these data indicate a chemical
method of optimizing the efficiency of operation of these molecular motors
without modifying their overall rotational frequency.},

rates and efficiencies of the reactions governing the rotary motion. Here,
we use computational methods to explore whether the thermal isomerisation

further improved by reducing the sizes of the motor halves. Presenting
three new redesigned motors that combine an indanylidene rotator with a

Then, by performing density functional calculations, we identify both
stepwise and concerted mechanisms for the thermal isomerisations of the
motors and show that the rate-determining free-energy barriers of these
processes are up to 25 kJ mol(-1) smaller than those of the original
motors. Furthermore, the thermal isomerisations of the redesigned motors
proceed in fewer steps. Altogether, the results suggest that the

entirely by the gating of the chemical reaction that provides the fuel for
the machine. The gating of the chemical free energy occurs through
chemical state dependent conformational changes of the molecular machine
that, in turn, are capable of generating directional mechanical motions.
In strong contrast to this general conclusion for molecular machines
driven by catalysis of a chemical reaction, a power stroke may be (and
often is) an essential component for a molecular machine driven by
external modulation of pH or redox potential or by light. This difference
between optical and chemical driving properties arises from the
fundamental symmetry difference between the physics of optical processes,
governed by the Bose-Einstein relations, and the constraints of
microscopic reversibility for thermally activated processes.},

nano-turbine composed of carbon nanotube and graphene nanoblades, which

quantitatively studied by molecular dynamics simulations on this model
system. A robust linear relationship is achieved with this nano-turbine
between its rotation rate and the fluid flow velocity spanning two orders
of magnitude, and this linear relationship remains intact at various
temperatures. More interestingly, a striking difference from its
macroscopic counterpart is identified: the rotation rate is much smaller
(by a factor of {\textasciitilde}15) than that of the macroscopic turbine with the same
driving flow. This discrepancy is shown to be related to the disruption of
water flow at nanoscale, together with the water slippage at graphene
surface and the so-called "dragging effect". Moreover, counterintuitively,
the ratio of "effective" driving flow velocity increases as the flow
velocity increases, suggesting that the linear dependence on the flow
velocity can be more complicated in nature. These findings may serve as a
foundation for the further development of rotary nano-devices and should
also be helpful for a better understanding of the biological molecular

how the character of rotary motion could be changed from a precessional
motion to an axial rotational motion. These concepts are then used to
design and build quantum chemical models of three distinct types of Schiff
base rotary motors. One of these models, featuring the synthetically
viable indanylidenepyrroline framework, has conical intersection
structures consistent with an axial rotation not hindered by ground-state
conformational barriers. It is expected that this type of motor should be

100\% in favour of the unstable form when irradiated in high viscosity

unidirectional light-driven molecular motor allows a more complete picture
of the pathway of thermal helix inversion to be developed. The most stable
conformation is similar to that found in related motors in that it has,
overall, an anti-folded structure with the substituent at the stereogenic
centre adopting an axial orientation. Photochemical cis/trans
isomerisation at -40 degrees C results in the formation of an isomer in a
syn-folded conformation with the methyl group in an axial orientation.
This contrasts with previous studies on related molecular rotary motors.
The conformation of the higher energy intermediate typically observed for
this class of compound is the anti-folded conformation, in which the
methyl group is in an equatorial orientation. This conformation is
available through an energetically uphill upper half ring inversion of the
observed photochemical product. However, this pathway competes with a
second process that leads to the more stable anti-folded conformation in
which the methyl group is oriented axially. It has been shown that the
conformations and pathways available for second-generation molecular
motors can be described by using similar overall geometries. Differences
in the metastable high-energy species are attributable to the relative
energy and position on the reaction coordinate of the transition states.
Kinetic studies on these new molecular motors thus provide important
insights into the conformational dynamics of the rotation cycle.},

Combining the data from different charge states (e.g., charged and

profiles can be computed accurately from equilibrium simulations, but they
are affected by a strong system-size dependence. We apply corrections for
these finite-size effects by using Ewald lattice summation and adding the
self-interactions consistently. An analogous procedure is used for the
reaction-field electrostatics. Results are presented for a model ion with
methane-like Lennard-Jones parameters in simple point charge water. We
find two very closely quadratic regimes with different parameters for
positive and negative ions. We also studied the hydration free energy of
potassium, calcium, fluoride, chloride, and bromide ions. We find negative
ions to be solvated more strongly (as measured by hydration free energies)
compared to positive ions of equal size, in agreement with experimental
data. We ascribe this preference of negative ions to their strong
interactions with water hydrogens, which can penetrate the ionic van der
Waals shell without direct energetic penalty in the models used. In
addition, we consistently find a positive electrostatic potential at the
center of uncharged Lennard-Jones particles in water, which also favors
negative ions. Regarding the effects of a finite system size, we show that
even using only 16 water molecules it is possible to calculate accurately
the hydration free energy of sodium, if self-interactions are considered.},

	abstract = {The dehydration of ion-water complexes prior to ion channel transit has
focused on channel protein-mediated dissociation of water. Ion dehydration
by the membrane electric field has not previously been considered. Near
membrane electric fields have previously been shown to cause the
disassociation of non-covalently bound small molecule-small molecule,
small molecule-protein, and protein-protein complexes. It is well known
that cosmotropic, structure making ions such as calcium and sodium
significantly bind multiple water ions in solution. It is also known that
these ions are often not hydrated as they pass through membrane ion
channels. Using capillary electrophoresis, the range of electric fields
needed to strip water molecules from calcium ions has been measured. Ion
migration velocity is a linear function of the electric field. At low
electric fields, the migration rate of calcium ion was shown to be
linearly related to the applied electric field. Using a form of the
Stoke's equation applicable to ion migration, the hydrated calcium radius
was found to be 0.334nm, corresponding to a water hydration shell of 5.09
water molecules. At higher electric fields, the slope of the calcium
migration velocity as a function of the electric field increased, which
was modeled as a decrease in the radius of the migrating ion as the water
was removed. Using a tanh function to model the transition of the ion from
a hydrated to a stripped state, the transition had a midpoint at 446V/cm,
and was 88\% complete at 587V/cm with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996.
The migration velocity of the stripped calcium ion was found to be a
function of both the decrease in radius and an increase in the effective,
electronic viscosity of the dipole medium through which the dehydrated ion
moved. The size of the electric field needed to dehydrate calcium occurs
6-7nm from the cell membrane. Calcium ions within this distance from the
membrane will be devoid of water molecules when they reach the calcium
selective channel pore entrances, all known to be approximately 1-2nm from
the membrane. No matter what the calcium pore structure, calcium ions
reaching the channel entrance will be devoid of a water shell.},

reduces the danger of iatrogenic damage of the vascular supply of the
scaphoid and accidental lesions of the superficial branches of the radial
nerve. Furthermore it provides a better exposure of the scapholunate joint
to correct lunate rotation. Iliac bone is preferred to the radial styloid

	abstract = {The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) is responsible for driving bacterial
locomotion and chemotaxis, fundamental processes in pathogenesis and
biofilm formation. In the BFM, torque is generated at the interface
between transmembrane proteins (stators) and a rotor. It is well
established that the passage of ions down a transmembrane gradient through
the stator complex provides the energy for torque generation. However, the
physics involved in this energy conversion remain poorly understood. Here
we propose a mechanically specific model for torque generation in the BFM.
In particular, we identify roles for two fundamental forces involved in
torque generation: electrostatic and steric. We propose that electrostatic
forces serve to position the stator, whereas steric forces comprise the
actual "power stroke." Specifically, we propose that ion-induced
conformational changes about a proline "hinge" residue in a stator α-helix
are directly responsible for generating the power stroke. Our model
predictions fit well with recent experiments on a single-stator motor. The
proposed model provides a mechanical explanation for several fundamental
properties of the flagellar motor, including torque-speed and speed-ion
motive force relationships, backstepping, variation in step sizes, and the
effects of key mutations in the stator.},

initial barrierless skeletal stretching coupled with torsional motion and
the decay process that takes place in the region of the twisted
intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) minimum state with an adjacent
conical intersection. The path is consistent with both biexponential decay
of fluorescence without rise time at short wavelengths and the rise time
followed by monoexponential decay at long wavelengths observed in
time-resolved experiments. For penta- and heptamethine cyanines, the
photoisomerization about different C−C bonds is shown to be an activated
process, where the torsional reaction path terminates, again, at a TICT
state and the decay takes place at a twisted S1/S0 conical intersection.
In agreement with the experimental results, the activation energies
increase with the length of the polymethine chain. In contrast to the
differences in the potential energy surface between short and long

respectively. On the other hand, τf values in highly viscous solvents such
as glycerol and poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) are already rather long at
room temperature (4–10 ns), and the fluorescence decays are not single
exponential but are analysed as double or triple exponential. A detailed
analysis of the multiple exponentials yields 7.8 ± 1.2 kJ mol–1 and (2.8 ±

dominant in non-viscous solvents. However, in PMMA this internal
conversion is totally suppressed and instead decay via an intermediate X,

(500 fs and 1.0 ps). By weighting the contributions of fast and slow decay
trajectories, the averaged lifetime of the S1excited state is about 710
fs. The calculated quantum yield of the M-to-P photoisomerization of this
molecular rotary motor is about 59.9\%. After the S0→ S1excitation, the
dynamical process of electronic decay is followed by twisting about the
central C═C double bond and the motion of pyramidalization at the carbon

indanylidene benzopyrrole frameworks are proposed and studied using
quantum chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics
simulations. These new motors perform pure axial rotation, and the
photochemical steps of the rotary cycle are dominated by the fast
bond-length-alternation motion that enables ultrafast access to the S1/S0
intersection. The new motors are predicted to display a quantum efficiency
higher than that of the currently available synthetic all-hydrocarbon
motors. Remarkably, the quantum efficiency is not governed by the
topography (peaked versus sloped) of the minimum-energy conical
intersection, whereas the S1 decay time depends on the topography as well
as on the energy of the intersection relative to the S1 minimum. It is the
axial chirality (helicity), rather than the point chirality, that controls
the sense of rotation of the motor.},

observe an extraordinarily fast initial relaxation out of the

they are common in biological systems. Rotary motion as such has been
induced in interlocked systems and directly visualized for single
molecules, but the controlled conversion of energy into unidirectional
rotary motion has remained difficult to achieve. Here we report
repetitive, monodirectional rotation around a central carbon-carbon double
bond in a chiral, helical alkene, with each 360 degrees rotation involving
four discrete isomerization steps activated by ultraviolet light or a
change in the temperature of the system. We find that axial chirality and
the presence of two chiral centres are essential for the observed
monodirectional behaviour of the molecular motor. Two light-induced
cis-trans isomerizations are each associated with a 180 degrees rotation
around the carbon-carbon double bond and are each followed by thermally
controlled helicity inversions, which effectively block reverse rotation
and thus ensure that the four individual steps add up to one full rotation
in one direction only. As the energy barriers of the helicity inversion
steps can be adjusted by structural modifications, chiral alkenes based on
our system may find use as basic components for 'molecular machinery'

from a remarkable confluence of experiment and theory. Synthetic
accomplishments have facilitated the ability to design and create
molecules, many of them featuring mechanically bonded components, to carry
out specific functions in their environment-walking along a polymeric
track, unidirectional circling of one ring about another, synthesizing
stereoisomers according to an external protocol, or pumping rings onto a
long rod-like molecule to form and maintain high-energy, complex,
nonequilibrium structures from simpler antecedents. Progress in the theory
of nanoscale stochastic thermodynamics, specifically the generalization
and extension of the principle of microscopic reversibility to the
single-molecule regime, has enhanced the understanding of the design
requirements for achieving strong unidirectional motion and high
efficiency of these synthetic molecular machines for harnessing energy
from external fluctuations to carry out mechanical and/or chemical
functions in their environment. A key insight is that the interaction
between the fluctuations and the transition state energies plays a central
role in determining the steady-state concentrations. Kinetic asymmetry, a
requirement for stochastic adaptation, occurs when there is an imbalance
in the effect of the fluctuations on the forward and reverse rate
constants. Because of strong viscosity, the motions of the machine can be
viewed as mechanical equilibrium processes where mechanical resonances are
simply impossible but where the probability distributions for the state
occupancies and trajectories are very different from those that would be

necessary structural relaxation falls behind the order parameter move, has
been a primary problem for generally low free-energy simulation
efficiency. Here, we propose an algorithm by achieving a random walk in
both the order parameter space and its generalized force space; thereby,
the order parameter move and the required conformational relaxation can be
efficiently synchronized. As demonstrated in both the alchemical
transition and the conformational transition, a leapfrog improvement in
free-energy simulation efficiency can be obtained; for instance, (i) it
allows us to solve a notoriously challenging problem: accurately
predicting the pK(a) value of a buried titratable residue, Asp-66, in the
interior of the V66E staphylococcal nuclease mutant, and (ii) it allows us

(PI(3,4,5)P3), is a key signaling lipid in the inner leaflet of the cell

growth and migration. In this study we investigate the impact of the
hydrogen-bond donor lipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and
phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the charge and phase behavior of PI(3,4,5)P3.
PE and PI can interact with PI(3,4,5)P3through hydrogen-bond formation,
leading to altered ionization behavior and charge distribution within the
PI(3,4,5)P3headgroup. We quantify the altered PI(3,4,5)P3ionization
behavior using a multistate ionization model to obtain micro-pKavalues for
the ionization of each phosphate group. The presence of PE leads to a
decrease in the pKavalues for the initial deprotonation of PI(3,4,5)P3,
which describes the removal of the first proton of the three protons
remaining at the phosphomonoester groups at pH 4.0. The decrease in these
micro-pKavalues thus leads to a higher charge at low pH. Additionally, the
charge distribution changes lead to increased charge on the 3- and
5-phosphates. In the presence of PI, the final deprotonation of
PI(3,4,5)P3is delayed, leading to a lower charge at high pH. This is due
to a combination of hydrogen-bond formation between PI and PI(3,4,5)P3,
and increased surface charge due to the addition of the negatively charged
PI. The interaction between PI and PI(3,4,5)P3leads to the formation of PI
and PI(3,4,5)P3-enriched domains within the membrane. These domains may
have a critical impact on PI(3,4,5)P3-signaling. We also reevaluate
results for all phosphatidylinositol bisphosphates as well as for
PI(4,5)P2in complex lipid mixtures with the multistate ionization model.},

"communities." Most of these communities included 40-60 residues and were
associated with a particular protein kinase function or a regulatory
mechanism, and well-known motifs based on sequence and secondary structure
were often split into different communities. The observed community maps
were sensitive to the presence of different ligands and provide a new
framework for interpreting long-distance allosteric coupling.
Communication between different communities was also in agreement with the
previously defined architecture of the protein kinase core based on the
"hydrophobic spine" network. This finding gives us confidence in
suggesting that community analyses can be used for other protein kinases

found to increase considerably (by 20-30 kJ mol-1 ), presumably due to
destabilization of the transition state by increased steric hindrance when
the fluorine atom is forced to pass over the lower half of the motor. This
results in the activation barrier for the thermal helix inversion to be
higher than the barrier for backward thermal E-Z isomerization, impairing

processes such as cell signaling and brain function. Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations have been used to study such interactions, however, the
accuracy of the Ca(2+) models provided by the standard MD force fields has
not been rigorously tested. Here, we assess the performance of the Ca(2+)
models from the most popular classical force fields AMBER and CHARMM by
computing the osmotic pressure of model compounds and the free energy of
DNA-DNA interactions. In the simulations performed using the two standard
models, Ca(2+) ions are seen to form artificial clusters with chloride,
acetate, and phosphate species; the osmotic pressure of CaAc2 and CaCl2
solutions is a small fraction of the experimental values for both force
fields. Using the standard parameterization of Ca(2+) ions in the
simulations of Ca(2+) -mediated DNA-DNA interactions leads to
qualitatively wrong outcomes: both AMBER and CHARMM simulations suggest
strong inter-DNA attraction whereas, in experiment, DNA molecules repel
one another. The artificial attraction of Ca(2+) to DNA phosphate is
strong enough to affect the direction of the electric field-driven
translocation of DNA through a solid-state nanopore. To address these
shortcomings of the standard Ca(2+) model, we introduce a custom model of
a hydrated Ca(2+) ion and show that using our model brings the results of
the above MD simulations in quantitative agreement with experiment. Our
improved model of Ca(2+) can be readily applied to MD simulations of
various biomolecular systems, including nucleic acids, proteins and lipid

macromolecules adopt highly ordered three-dimensional structures that
define their functions. The key to folding of a biopolymer into a unique
3D structure or to an assembly of several biopolymers into a functional
unit is a delicate balance between the attractive and repulsive forces
that also makes such self-assembly reversible under physiological
conditions. The all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) method has emerged as a
powerful tool for studies of individual biomolecules and their functional
assemblies, encompassing systems of ever increasing complexity. However,
advances in parallel computing technology have outpaced the development of
the underlying theoretical models-the molecular force fields, pushing the
MD method into an untested territory. Recent tests of the MD method have
found the most commonly used molecular force fields to be out of balance,
overestimating attractive interactions between charged and hydrophobic
groups, which can promote artificial aggregation in MD simulations of
multi-component protein, nucleic acid, and lipid systems. One route
towards improving the force fields is through the NBFIX corrections
method, in which the intermolecular forces are calibrated against
experimentally measured quantities such as osmotic pressure by making atom
pair-specific adjustments to the non-bonded interactions. In this article,
we review development of the NBFIX (Non-Bonded FIX) corrections to the
AMBER and CHARMM force fields and discuss their implications for MD

calculated as the sum of all electrostatic, solvophobic and specific

and some features of ionic permeation, particularly if the solvophobic
energy is taken into account. Ionic and dipole permeabilities are
extremely sensitive to the ionic/dipolar radius. Despite this sensitivity,
calculations of the permeability can be carried out for typical monovalent
cations, and provide reasonable estimates, but only for hydrated species.
An alternative mechanism proposed for ionic permeation involves the
occurrence of transient pore-like defects in lipid bilayers which permit
ions to bypass the Born energy barrier. The two alternative hypothesis,
partitioning vs. transient pores, can be tested by measuring the ionic and
dipolar permeation through bilayers of varying thickness. Experimental
observations for both potassium and proton permeability are consistent
with the transient pore mechanism for shorter chain lipids, but tend
towards the theoretical line for partitioning models for longer chain
lipids. Results for small neutral solutes are best explained by the
solubility-diffusion mechanism. The proposed method of calculation of the
Gibbs free energy of ion or dipole membrane transfer and the liquid
membrane permittivity can be effectively used not only in describing the
biophysical properties of membranes, but also in extraction processes,

particle assembly. In this study, we simulated the membrane anchoring of
human immunodeficiency virus-1 myristoylated MA protein using a
coarse-grained representation of both the protein and the membrane. Our
calculations first suggest that the myristoyl group could spontaneously
release from its initial hydrophobic pocket before MA protein interacts
with the lipid membrane. All-atom simulations confirmed this possibility
with a related energy cost estimated to be {\textasciitilde}5 kcal.mol(-1). The
phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) head binds
preferentially to the MA highly basic region as described in available NMR
data, but interestingly without flipping of its 2' acyl chain into the MA
protein. Moreover, MA was able to confine PI(4,5)P2 lipids all around its
molecular surface after having found a stable orientation at the membrane
surface. Our results suggest that this orientation is dependent on Myr
anchoring and that this confinement induces a lateral segregation of
PI(4,5)P2 in domains. This is consistent with a PI(4,5)P2 enrichment of
the virus envelope as compared to the host cell membrane.},

that the juxtamembrane (JM) regions of RTKs are critical for inducing
clustering of anionic lipids, including PIP2, both in simple asymmetric

driven by interactions between a conserved cluster of basic residues
within the first five positions of the JM region, and negatively charged
lipid headgroups. This highlights a conserved interaction pattern shared
across the human RTK family. In particular predominantly the N-terminal
residues of the JM region are involved in the interactions with PIP2,

release it to interact with other biologically important molecules.},

	abstract = {Interactions between protein domains and lipid molecules play key roles in
controlling cell membrane signalling and trafficking. The pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain is one of the most widespread, binding specifically
to phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in cell membranes. PH domains
must locate specific PIPs in the presence of a background of approximately
20\% anionic lipids within the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane.
We investigate the mechanism of such recognition via a multiscale
procedure combining Brownian dynamics (BD) and molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of the GRP1 PH domain interacting with phosphatidylinositol
(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P₃). The interaction of GRP1-PH with
PI(3,4,5)P₃ in a zwitterionic bilayer is compared with the interaction in
bilayers containing different levels of anionic 'decoy' lipids. BD
simulations reveal both translational and orientational electrostatic
steering of the PH domain towards the PI(3,4,5)P₃-containing anionic
bilayer surface. There is a payoff between non-PIP anionic lipids
attracting the PH domain to the bilayer surface in a favourable
orientation and their role as 'decoys', disrupting the interaction of
GRP1-PH with the PI(3,4,5)P₃ molecule. Significantly, approximately 20\%
anionic lipid in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer is nearly optimal
to both enhance orientational steering and to localise GRP1-PH proximal to
the surface of the membrane without sacrificing its ability to locate
PI(3,4,5)P₃ within the bilayer plane. Subsequent MD simulations reveal
binding to PI(3,4,5)P₃, forming protein-phosphate contacts comparable to
those in X-ray structures. These studies demonstrate a computational
framework which addresses lipid recognition within a cell membrane
environment, offering a link between structural and cell biological
characterisation.},

purified recombinant PI-phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) at all

PI-PLC-delta at low concentrations (10 microM), while severely inhibiting
their activities at higher concentrations. In the breast cancer cell lines
MCF-7 (estrogen receptor positive) and MDA-MB-468 (estrogen receptor

severely inhibited its incorporation into PI. In spite of the drastic
decrease in PI synthesis, C4-PI did not affect the levels of inositol
incorporated into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the
cells. In vitro assays showed that C4-PI inhibited PI synthase activity
(inhibition of 35\% at 50 microM) but had little effect on PI 4-kinase

proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines with IC(50) values of 12

intracellular proteins in vitro. The much more restricted targeting of
proteins to PPIs in cell membranes is thought to result in part from the
formation of spatially distinct PIP2 pools, but the mechanisms that cause
formation and maintenance of PIP2 clusters are still under debate. The
hypothesis that PIP2 forms submicrometer-sized clusters in the membrane by
electrostatic interactions with intracellular divalent cations is tested
here using lipid monolayer and bilayer model membranes. Competitive
binding between Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) to PIP2 is quantified by surface
pressure measurements and analyzed by a Langmuir competitive adsorption
model. The physical chemical differences among three PIP2 isomers are also
investigated. Addition of Ca(2+) but not Mg(2+), Zn(2+), or polyamines to
PIP2-containing monolayers induces surface pressure drops coincident with
the formation of PIP2 clusters visualized by fluorescence, atomic force,
and electron microscopy. Studies of bilayer membranes using steady-state
probe-partitioning fluorescence resonance energy transfer (SP-FRET) and
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) also reveal divalent metal ion
(Me(2+))-induced cluster formation or diffusion retardation, which follows
the trend: Ca(2+) ≫ Mg(2+) {\textgreater} Zn(2+), and polyamines have minimal effects.
These results suggest that divalent metal ions have substantial effects on
PIP2 lateral organization at physiological concentrations, and local
fluxes in their cytoplasmic levels can contribute to regulating
protein-PIP2 interactions.},

the question to what extent the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch

propose a theoretical model for the adsorption of a basic protein on a

component. Our model is based on an extended continuum Poisson-Boltzmann
approach that accounts for zwitterionic lipids, the
protonation/deprotonation equilibrium of PA, and the lateral mobility of
the lipids in the membrane. The electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch enters
as an additional non-electrostatic attractive interaction of deprotonated
PA with basic protein residues. For a generic model protein we calculate
the adsorption free energy and its pH-dependence. Our results suggest that
the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch not only increases the affinity
between PA and the protein but also its sensitivity with respect to
changes in pH. That is, the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch helps
enabling the membrane to use physiological pH changes in order to trigger

suggests that insertion of the protein's N-terminal amphipathic segments

issue through all-atom and coarse-grained simulations of multiple
amphiphysin N-BAR domains and their components interacting with a

	abstract = {Molecular mechanics force fields, which are commonly used in biomolecular modeling and computer-aided drug design, typically treat nonbonded interactions using a limited library of empirical parameters that are developed for small molecules. This approach does not account for polarization in larger molecules or proteins, and the parametrization process is labor-intensive. Using linear-scaling density functional theory and atoms-in-molecule electron density partitioning, environment-specific charges and Lennard-Jones parameters are derived directly from quantum mechanical calculations for use in biomolecular modeling of organic and biomolecular systems. The proposed methods significantly reduce the number of empirical parameters needed to construct molecular mechanics force fields, naturally include polarization effects in charge and Lennard-Jones parameters, and scale well to systems comprised of thousands of atoms, including proteins. The feasibility and benefits of this approach are demonstrated by computing free energies of hydration, properties of pure liquids, and the relative binding free energies of indole and benzofuran to the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme.},

However, it is not clear if the correlation between predicted and experimental binding affinities can be improved by explicitly considering selected water molecules in the calculation of binding energies, since different and sometimes diverging opinions are found in the literature. In this work, we evaluated how variably populated hydration shells explicitly considered around the ligands may affect the correlation between MM-PB/GBSA computed binding energy and biological activities (IC50 and ?Gbind, depending on the available experimental data). Four different systems?namely, the DNA-topoisomerase complex, α-thrombin, penicillopepsin, and avidin?were considered and ligand hydration shells populated by 10?70 water molecules were systematically evaluated. We found that the consideration of a hydration shell populated by a number of water residues (Nwat) between 30 and 70 provided, in all of the considered examples, a positive effect on correlation between MM-PB/GBSA calculated binding affinities and experimental activities, with a negligible increment of computational cost.},

Encouraging results have been obtained not only for the relative binding free energies, but also for the absolute ones, which have a root-mean-square deviation of 1.0 kcal/mol (the maximum error is 1.89 kcal/mol). Since the root-mean-square error is rather small, this approach can be reliably applied in ranking the ligands from the databases for this important target. Encouraged by the results, we decided to apply MM-PBSA combined with molecular docking to determine the binding mode of efavirenz SUSTIVATM another promising HIV-1 RT inhibitor for which no ligand−protein crystal structure had been published at the time of this work. To proceed, we define the following ansatz:  Five hundred picosecond molecular dynamics simulations were first performed for the five binding modes suggested by DOCK 4.0, and then MM-PBSA was carried out for the collected snapshots. MM-PBSA successfully identified the correct binding mode, which has a binding free energy about 7 kcal/mol more favorable than the second best mode. Moreover, the calculated binding free energy (−13.2 kcal/mol) is in reasonable agreement with experiment (−11.6 kcal/mol). In addition, this procedure was also quite successful in modeling the complex and the structure of the last snapshot was quite close to that of the measured 2,3 Å resolution crystal (structure the root-mean-square deviation of the 54 Cα around the binding site and the inhibitor is 1.1 Å). We want to point out that this result was achieved without prior knowledge of the structure of the efavirenz/RT complex. Therefore, molecular docking combined with MD simulations followed by MM-PBSA analysis is an attractive approach for modeling protein complexes a priori.},

The methods, which can be applied to derive binding increments for single noncovalent interactions, start with the evaluation of consistency and additivity with a sufficiently large number of different host–guest complexes by applying linear free energy relations. Other strategies involve the use of double mutant cycles, of molecular balances, of dynamic combinatorial libraries, and of crystal structures. Promises and limitations of these strategies are discussed. Most of the analyses stem from solution studies, but a few also from gas phase. The empirically derived interactions are then presented on the basis of selected complexes with respect to ion pairing, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic contributions, halogen bonding, π–π-stacking, dispersive forces, cation−π and anion−π interactions, and contributions from the hydrophobic effect. Cooperativity in host–guest complexes as well as in self-assembly, and entropy factors are briefly highlighted.

This remains a challenge for RNA because its rugged energy landscape results in slow conformational sampling and accurate results typically require explicit solvent which increases computational cost. To address this, we performed both traditional and modified replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on a test system (alanine dipeptide) and an RNA tetramer known to populate A-form-like conformations in solution (single-stranded rGACC). A key focus is on providing the means to demonstrate that convergence is obtained, for example, by investigating replica RMSD profiles and/or detailed ensemble analysis through clustering. We found that traditional replica exchange simulations still require prohibitive time and resource expenditures, even when using GPU accelerated hardware, and our results are not well converged even at 2 μs of simulation time per replica. In contrast, a modified version of replica exchange, reservoir replica exchange in explicit solvent, showed much better convergence and proved to be both a cost-effective and reliable alternative to the traditional approach. We expect this method will be attractive for future research that requires quantitative conformational analysis from explicitly solvated simulations.},

Comparisons between NMR data and molecular dynamics simulations provide a test of force fields used for modeling. Here, NMR spectroscopy, including NOESY, 1H–31P HETCOR, DQF-COSY, and TOCSY, was used to determine conformational preferences for single-stranded GACC RNA. The spectra are consistent with a conformational ensemble containing major and minor A-form-like structures. In a series of 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the AMBER99 force field in explicit solvent, initial A-form-like structures rapidly evolve to disordered conformations. A set of 50 ns simulations with revised χ torsions (AMBER99χ force field) gives two primary conformations, consistent with the NMR spectra. A single 1.9 μs MD simulation with the AMBER99χ force field showed that the major and minor conformations are retained for almost 68\% of the time in the first 700 ns, with multiple transformations from A-form to non-A-form conformations. For the rest of the simulation, random-coil structures and a stable non-A-form conformation inconsistent with NMR spectra were seen. Evidently, the AMBER99χ force field improves structural predictions for single-stranded GACC RNA compared to the AMBER99 force field, but further force field improvements are needed.},

We report here the NMR structure of a domain IIa construct in complex with a potent small-molecule inhibitor of HCV replication. Molecular dynamics refinement in explicit solvent and subsequent energetic analysis indicated that each inhibitor stereoisomer bound with comparable affinity and in an equivalent binding mode. The in silico analysis was substantiated by fluorescence-based assays showing that the relative binding free energies differed by only 0.7 kcal/mol. Binding of the inhibitor displaces key nucleotide residues within the bulge region, effecting a major conformational change that eliminates the bent RNA helical trajectory, providing a mechanism for the antiviral activity of this inhibitor class.},

We demonstrate their utility—using modern simulation protocols, optimized force fields, and inclusion of explicit solvent and mobile counterions—by re-investigating the solution structures of two RNA hairpins that had previously been refined using conventional techniques. The structures, both domain 5 group II intron ribozymes from yeast ai5γ and Pylaiella littoralis, share a nearly identical primary sequence yet the published 3D structures appear quite different. Relatively long restrained MD simulations using the original NMR restraint data identified the presence of a small set of violated distance restraints in one structure and a possibly incorrect trapped bulge nucleotide conformation in the other structure. The removal of problematic distance restraints and the addition of a heating step yielded representative ensembles with very similar 3D structures and much lower pairwise RMSD values. Analysis of ion density during the restrained simulations helped to explain chemical shift perturbation data published previously. These results suggest that restrained MD simulations, with proper caution, can be used to “update” older structures or aid in the refinement of new structures that lack sufficient experimental data to produce a high quality result. Notable cautions include the need for sufficient sampling, awareness of potential force field bias (such as small angle deviations with the current AMBER force fields), and a proper balance between the various restraint weights.},

The conformers are given two-character names that reflect the seven-angle δεζαβγδ combinations empirically found favorable for the sugar-to-sugar “suite” unit within which the angle correlations are strongest (e.g., 1a for A-form, 5z for the start of S-motifs). Since the half-nucleotides are specified by a number for δεζ and a lowercase letter for αβγδ, this modular system can also be parsed to describe traditional nucleotide units (e.g., a1) or the dinucleotides (e.g., a1a1) that are especially useful at the level of crystallographic map fitting. This nomenclature can also be written as a string with two-character suite names between the uppercase letters of the base sequence (N1aG1gN1aR1aA1cN1a for a GNRA tetraloop), facilitating bioinformatic comparisons. Cluster means, standard deviations, coordinates, and examples are made available, as well as the Suitename software that assigns suite conformer names and conformer match quality (suiteness) from atomic coordinates.

Our model reports large uncertainties for the molecules that appear to have chemistry outside our domain of applicability, along with good agreement in quantile-quantile plots, indicating it can predict its own accuracy.The challenge highlighted a variety of means to improve our model, including adding more polyprotic molecules to our training set and more carefully considering what functional groups we do or do not identify as ionizable.},

	abstract = {In this study, we demonstrate the extensive scalability of the biasing potential replica exchange multisite λ-dynamics (BP-REX MSλD) free energy method by calculating binding affinities for 512 inhibitors to HIV Reverse Transcriptase (HIV-RT). This is the largest exploration of chemical space using free energy methods known to date, requires only a few simulations, and identifies 55 new inhibitor designs against HIV-RT predicted to be at least as potent as a tight binding reference compound (i.e., as potent as 56 nM). We highlight that BP- REX MSλD requires an order of magnitude less computational resources than conventional free energy methods while maintaining a similar level of precision, overcomes the inherent poor scalability of conventional free energy methods, and enables the exploration of combinatorially large chemical spaces in the context of in silico drug discovery.},

	abstract = {Many neurological disorders are initiated by blood–brain barrier breakdown, which potentiates spinal neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Peripheral neuropathic injuries are known to disrupt the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and to potentiate inflammation. But, it is not known whether BSCB breakdown facilitates pain development. In this study, a neural compression model in the rat was used to evaluate relationships among BSCB permeability, inflammation and pain-related behaviors. BSCB permeability increases transiently only after injury that induces mechanical hyperalgesia, which correlates with serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-7, IL-12, IL-1α and TNF-α. Mammalian thrombin dually regulates vascular permeability through PAR1 and activated protein C (APC). Since thrombin protects vascular integrity through APC, directing its affinity towards protein C, while still promoting coagulation, might be an ideal treatment for BSCB-disrupting disorders. Salmon thrombin, which prevents the development of mechanical allodynia, also prevents BSCB breakdown after neural injury and actively inhibits TNF-α-induced endothelial permeability in vitro, which is not evident the case for human thrombin. Salmon thrombin's production of APC faster than human thrombin is confirmed using a fluorogenic assay and APC is shown to inhibit BSCB breakdown and pain-related behaviors similar to salmon thrombin. Together, these studies highlight the impact of BSCB on pain and establish salmon thrombin as an effective blocker of BSCB, and resulting nociception, through its preferential affinity for protein C.},

Incorporation of a bipyridine ligand into the UiO-67 lattice transforms the crystallites, upon metalation, into single-site, metal-based catalytic “engines” to power the micromotors with chemical fuel. The “engine performance” (i.e., propulsion) of the single-site powered micromotors has been tuned by the choice of the metal ion utilized. In addition, a chemical “braking” system was achieved by adding chelating agents capable of sequestering the metal ion engines and thereby suppressing the catalytic activity, with different chelators displaying different deceleration capacities. These results demonstrate that MOFs can be powered by various engines and halted by different brakes, resulting in a high degree of motion design and control at the nanoscale.},

We compare this state to the subsequent state on actin (Rigor). The ADP-bound structure reveals that the actin-binding cleft is closed, even though MgADP is tightly bound. This state is accomplished by a previously unseen conformation of the β-sheet underlying the nucleotide pocket. The transition from the force-generating ADP state to Rigor requires a 9.5° rotation of the myosin lever arm, coupled to a β-sheet rearrangement. Thus, the structure reveals the detailed rearrangements underlying myosin force generation as well as the basis of strain-dependent ADP release that is essential for processive myosins, such as myosin V.},

In adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, each kinesin-1 dimer binds two tubulin heterodimers.

	abstract = {Biomolecular machines consume free energy to break symmetry and make directed progress. Nonequilibrium ATP concentrations are the typical free energy source, with one cycle of a molecular machine consuming a certain number of ATP, providing a fixed free energy budget. Since evolution is expected to favor rapid-turnover machines that operate efficiently, we investigate how this free energy budget can be allocated to maximize flux. Unconstrained optimization eliminates intermediate metastable states, indicating that flux is enhanced in molecular machines with fewer states. When maintaining a set number of states, we show that---in contrast to previous findings---the flux-maximizing allocation of dissipation is not even. This result is consistent with the coexistence of both `irreversible' and reversible transitions in molecular machine models that successfully describe experimental data, which suggests that in evolved machines different transitions differ significantly in their dissipation.},

Bilaterally isolated carotid chemoreceptors were perfused with autologous blood of varying O2 and CO2 tensions via an extracorporeal lung circuit. Systemic gas tensions were unchanged. Effects of carotid chemoreceptor stimulation on coronary vascular resistance, left ventricular dP/dt, and strain-gauge arch output were studied at natural coronary blood flow with the chest closed and during constant-flow perfusion of the left common coronary artery with the chest open. Carotid chemoreceptor stimulation slightly increased left ventricular dP/dt and slightly decreased the strain-gauge arch output, while markedly increasing systemic pressure. Coronary blood flow increased; however, coronary vascular resistance wa.as not affected. These studies show that local carotid body stimulation increases coronary blood flow but has little effect on the myocardium. The increase in coronary blood flow results mainly from an increase in systemic arterial pressure. Thus these data provide little evidence for increased sympathetic activity of the heart during local stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptors with hypoxic and hypercapnic blood.},

Like small G-proteins, to which they are related, kinesins execute a program of active site conformational changes that cleaves the terminal phosphate from an NTP substrate. But unlike small G-proteins, kinesins can amplify and harness these conformational changes in order to exert force. In this short review I summarize current ideas about how the kinesin active site works and outline how the active site chemistry is coupled to the larger-scale structural cycle of the kinesin motor domain. Focusing largely on kinesin-1, the best-studied kinesin, I discuss how the active site switch machinery of kinesin cycles between three distinct states, how docking of the neck linker stabilizes two of these states, and how tension-sensitive and position-sensitive neck linker docking may modulate both the hydrolysis step of ATP turnover and the trapping of product ADP in the active site. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Previous theoretical attempts to do so have provided interesting insights on parts of the cycle but could not generate a structure-based free energy landscape for the complete cycle of myosin. In particular, a nonphenomenological structure/energy-based understanding of the unidirectional motion is still missing. Here we use a coarse-grained model of myosin V and generate a structure-based free energy surface of the largest conformational change, namely the transition from the post- to prepowerstroke movement. We also couple the observed energetics of ligand binding/hydrolysis and product release to that of the conformational surface and reproduce the energetics of the complete mechanochemical cycle. It is found that the release in electrostatic free energy upon changing the conformation of the lever arm and the convertor domain from its post- to prepowerstroke state provides the necessary energy to bias the system towards the unidirectional movement of myosin V on the actin filament. The free energy change of 11 kcal is also in the range of ∼2-3 pN, which is consistent with the experimentally observed stalling force required to stop the motor completely on its track. The conformational-chemical coupling generating a successful powerstroke cycle is believed to be conserved among most members of the myosin family, thus highlighting the importance of the previously unknown role of electrostatics free energy in guiding the functional cycle in other actin-based myosin motors.},

Structural levels in the hierarchy range from α-carbon or phosphate backbones through secondary structure to domains, molecules, and multimers with each level represented in an identical data structure that can be manipulated using the application programming interface. Unlike most coarse-grained simulation approaches, the higher-level objects represented in SimGen can be soft, allowing the lower-level objects that they contain to interact directly.
The default motion simulated by SimGen is a Brownian-like diffusion that can be set to occur across all levels of representation in the hierarchy. Links can also be defined between objects, which, when combined with large high-level random movements, result in an effective search strategy for constraint satisfaction, including structure prediction from predicted pairwise distances.
The implementation of SimGen makes use of the hierarchic data structure to avoid unnecessary calculation, especially for collision detection, allowing it to be simultaneously run and viewed on a laptop computer while simulating large systems of over 20,000 objects. It has been used previously to model complex molecular interactions including the motion of a myosin-V dimer “walking” on an actin fibre, RNA stem-loop packing, and the simulation of cell motion and aggregation.

Via a hydrogen bond between the side-chain of Asn475 on the relay helix and the Gly457/Ser456 peptide group on the Switch-2, the rotation of the converter domain is coupled to the formation of a hydrogen bond between Gly457 and gamma-phosphate that is essential for ATP hydrolysis. Here, molecular dynamics simulations of Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II in the two end conformations of the recovery stroke with different nucleotide states (ATP, ADP x Pi, ADP) reveal that the side-chain of Asn475 breaks away from Switch-2 upon ATP hydrolysis to make a hydrogen bond with Tyr573. This sensing of the nucleotide state is achieved by a small displacement of the cleaved gamma-phosphate towards Gly457 which in turn pushes Asn475 away. The sensing plays a dual role by (i) preventing the wasteful reversal of the recovery stroke while the nucleotide is in the ADP x Pi state, and (ii) decoupling the relay helix from Switch-2, thus allowing the power stroke to start upon initial binding to actin while Gly457 of Switch-2 keeps interacting with the Pi (known to be released only later after tight actin binding). A catalytically important salt bridge between Arg238 (on Switch-1) and Glu459 (on Switch-2), which covers the hydrolysis site, is seen to form rapidly when ATP is added to the pre-recovery stroke conformer and remains stable after the recovery stroke, indicating that it has a role in shaping the ATP binding site by induced fit.},

It remains unknown how such kinetic variations arise from the structural and dynamic tuning of the actin-myosin interface at the amino acid residue level. To address this key issue, we have employed molecular modeling and simulations to investigate, with atomistic details, the isoform dependence of actin-myosin interactions in the rigor state. By combining electron microscopy-based docking with homology modeling, we have constructed three all-atom models for human cardiac α and β and rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin in complex with three actin subunits in the rigor state. Starting from these models, we have performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (total of 100 ns per system) and then used the MD trajectories to calculate actin-myosin binding free energies with contributions from both electrostatic and nonpolar forces. Our binding calculations are in good agreement with the experimental finding of isoform-dependent differences in actin binding affinity between these myosin isoforms. Such differences are traced to changes in actin-myosin electrostatic interactions (i.e., hydrogen bonds and salt bridges) that are highly dynamic and involve several flexible actin-binding loops. By partitioning the actin-myosin binding free energy to individual myosin residues, we have also identified key myosin residues involved in the actin-myosin interactions, some of which were previously validated experimentally or implicated in cardiomyopathy mutations, and the rest make promising targets for future mutational experiments.},

The motor domain is modeled in the pre-powerstroke state, in the post-rigor state, and as a hybrid based on the post-rigor state with a closed nucleotide-binding pocket. The ATP hydrolysis activity is found to depend on the positioning of nearby water molecules, and a network of polar residues facilitates proton transfer and charge redistribution during hydrolysis. Comparison of the observed hydrolysis pathways and the corresponding free energy profiles leads to detailed models for the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis in the pre-powerstroke state and proposes factors that regulate the hydrolysis activity in different conformational states. In the pre-powerstroke state, the scissile Pγ-O3β bond breaks early in the reaction. Proton transfer from the lytic water to the γ-phosphate through active site residues is an important part of the kinetic bottleneck; several hydrolysis pathways that feature distinct proton transfer routes are found to have similar free energy barriers, suggesting a significant degree of plasticity in the hydrolysis mechanism. Comparison of hydrolysis in the pre-powerstroke state and the closed post-rigor model suggests that optimization of residues beyond the active site for electrostatic stabilization and preorganization is likely important to enzyme design.},

After a power stroke, a recovery transition completes the cycle and returns the molecular motor to its prestroke state. Atomically detailed simulations in the framework of the Milestoning theory are used to calculate kinetics and mechanisms of the recovery stroke. Milestoning divides the process into transitions between hyper-surfaces (Milestones) along a reaction coordinate. Decorrelation of dynamics between sequential Milestones is assumed, which speeds up the atomically detailed simulations by a factor of millions. Two hundred trajectories of myosin with explicit water solvation are used to sample transitions between sequential pairs of Milestones. Collective motions of hundreds of atoms are described at atomic resolution and at the millisecond time scale. The experimentally measured transition time of about a millisecond is in good agreement with the computed time. The simulations support a sequential mechanism. In the first step the P-loop and switch 2 close on the ATP and in the second step the mechanical relaxation is induced via the relay and the SH1 helices. We propose that the entropy of switch 2 helps to drive the power stroke. Secondary structure elements are progressing through a small number of discrete states in a network of activated transitions and are assisted by side chain flips between rotameric states. The few-state sequential mechanism is likely to enhance the efficiency of the relaxation reducing the probability of off-pathway intermediates.},

	abstract = {Myosins are typical molecular motor proteins that convert the chemical energy from the ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work. The fundamental mechanism of this energy conversion is still unknown. To explain the experimental results already obtained, Masuda has proposed a hypothesis called the “Driven by Detachment” theory for the working principle of the myosins. This theory insists that the energy used during the power stroke of the myosins does not directly originate from the chemical energy of ATP, but is converted from the elastic energy within the molecule at the joint between the head and neck domains. One method for demonstrating the validity of this theory is a computational simulation using the molecular dynamics (MD) method. The MD software used was GROMACS. The target of the MD simulations was myosin subfragment-1 (S1), for which the initial structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank entry 1M8Q. The AFM pull code of GROMACS was used to apply an external force of 17 pN at the end of the neck domain in the direction opposite to the power stroke to observe whether the myosin S1 takes the pre-power stroke conformation. The residues assumed to be engaged in the docking with an actin filament were fixed to the space. Starting from exactly the same initial position, 10 simulations were repeated by varying the random seeds for generating the initial velocities of the atoms. After 64 ns of calculations, the myosin S1 took the conformation of the pre-power stroke state in which the neck domain was bent around the joint between the head and the neck domains. This result agrees with the prediction expected by the DbD theory, the validity of which may be established by conducting similar simulations for the other steps of the myosin working processes.},

Starting with coordinates derived from the heavy atoms of the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 1VOM) in which myosin is bound to the ATP analog ADP.VO(4)(-), a minimum-energy path is found for the transformation ATP + H(2)O --{\textgreater} ADP + P(i) that is characterized by two distinct events: (i) a low activation-energy cleavage of the P(gamma) O(betagamma) bond and separation of the gamma-phosphate from ADP and (ii) the formation of the inorganic phosphate as a consequence of proton transfers mediated by two water molecules and assisted by the Glu-459-Arg-238 salt bridge of the protein. The minimum-energy model of the enzyme-substrate complex features a stable hydrogen-bonding network in which the lytic water is positioned favorably for a nucleophilic attack of the ATP gamma-phosphate and for the transfer of a proton to stably bound second water. In addition, the P(gamma) O(betagamma) bond has become significantly longer than in the unbound state of the ATP and thus is predisposed to cleavage. The modeled transformation is viewed as the part of the overall hydrolysis reaction occurring in the closed enzyme pocket after ATP is bound tightly to myosin and before conformational changes preceding release of inorganic phosphate.},

	abstract = {The molecular motor myosin V (MyoV) exhibits a wide repertoire of pathways during the stepping process, which is intimately connected to its biological function. The best understood of these is the hand-over-hand stepping by a swinging lever arm movement toward the plus end of actin filaments. Single-molecule experiments have also shown that the motor "foot stomps," with one hand detaching and rebinding to the same site, and back-steps under sufficient load. The complete taxonomy of MyoV's load-dependent stepping pathways, and the extent to which these are constrained by motor structure and mechanochemistry, are not understood. Using a polymer model, we develop an analytical theory to describe the minimal physical properties that govern motor dynamics. We solve the first-passage problem of the head reaching the target-binding site, investigating the competing effects of backward load, strain in the leading head biasing the diffusion in the direction of the target, and the possibility of preferential binding to the forward site due to the recovery stroke. The theory reproduces a variety of experimental data, including the power stroke and slow diffusive search regimes in the mean trajectory of the detached head, and the force dependence of the forward-to-backward step ratio, run length, and velocity. We derive a stall force formula, determined by lever arm compliance and chemical cycle rates. By exploring the MyoV design space, we predict that it is a robust motor whose dynamical behavior is not compromised by reasonable perturbations to the reaction cycle and changes in the architecture of the lever arm.},

In both motors, microtubule binding promotes ordered conformations of conserved loops that stimulate ADP release, enhance microtubule affinity and prime the catalytic site for ATP binding. ATP binding causes only small shifts of these nucleotide-coordinating loops but induces large conformational changes elsewhere that allow force generation and neck linker docking towards the microtubule plus end. Family-specific differences across the kinesin-microtubule interface account for the distinctive properties of each motor. Our data thus provide evidence for a conserved ATP-driven mechanism for kinesins and reveal the critical mechanistic contribution of the microtubule interface.},

	abstract = {Molecular motors such as kinesin are essential for many biological processes. These motors have two motor domains, which bind to tubulin filaments, hydrolyze ATP, and transduce the released chemical energy into directed movements. The general principles of this chemomechanical coupling are now well-established but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive because small conformational changes within large proteins are difficult to detect experimentally. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to monitor such changes within a single motor domain of KIF1A, which belongs to the kinesin-3 motor family. The nucleotide binding pocket of this domain can be empty or occupied by ATP or ADP. For these three nucleotide states, we determine the mobility of the backbone of the protein, both in solution and attached to tubulin. Only one subdomain of the motor domain is found to exhibit a strongly increased mobility upon binding to tubulin: the neck linker that presumably acts as a mechanical transmitter to the other motor domain in dimeric kinesin-3 motors. Furthermore, upon binding to tubulin, the neck linker mobility becomes sensitive to the bound nucleotide and is highly increased after phosphate release, which implies undocking of this linker from the core of the motor domain. These simulation results are consistent with experimental data from EPR spectroscopy, FRET, and cryo-electron microscopy. A detailed analysis of our simulation data also reveals that the undocking of the neck linker in the ADP-kinesin-tubulin state arises from allosteric interactions between the nucleotide and tubulin and that the β-sheet core undergoes a twist both during phosphate release and ATP binding. The computational approach used here can be applied to other motor domains and mechanoenzymes in order to identify allosteric interactions between the subdomains of these proteins.},

Defining the mechanical and biochemical determinates of kinesin processivity is important for understanding how diverse kinesins are tuned for specific cellular functions. Because transmission of mechanical forces through the 14–18 amino acid neck linker domain underlies coordinated stepping [1–6], we investigated the role of neck linker length, charge, and structure in kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 motor behavior. For optimum comparison with kinesin-1, the KIF3A head and neck linker of kinesin-2 were fused to the kinesin-1 neck coil and rod. Extending the 14-residue kinesin-1 neck linker reduced processivity, and shortening the 17-residue kinesin-2 neck linker enhanced processivity. When a proline in the kinesin-2 neck linker was replaced, kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 run lengths scaled identically with neck linker length, despite moving at different speeds. In low-ionic-strength buffer, charge had a dominant effect on motor processivity, which resolves ongoing controversy regarding the effect of neck linker length on kinesin processivity [3, 5–7]. From stochastic simulations, the results are best explained by neck linker extension slowing strain-dependent detachment of the rear head along with diminishing strain-dependent inhibition of ATP binding. These results help delineate how interhead strain maximizes stepping and suggest that less processive kinesins are tuned to coordinate with other motors differently than the maximally processive kinesin-1.},

In kinesin motors, a fundamental question concerns the mechanism by which ATP binding generates the force required for walking. Analysis of available structures combined with molecular dynamics simulations demonstrates that the conformational change of the neck linker involves the nine-residue-long N-terminal region, the cover strand, as an element that is essential for force generation. Upon ATP binding, it forms a β sheet with the neck linker, the cover-neck bundle, which induces the forward motion of the neck linker, followed by a latch-type binding to the motor head. The estimated stall force and anisotropic response to external loads calculated from the model agree with force-clamp measurements. The proposed mechanism for force generation by the cover-neck bundle formation appears to apply to several kinesin families. It also elucidates the design principle of kinesin as the smallest known processive motor.},

One puzzle is that the neck linker appears too short for the 4-nm distance each linker must stretch to enable an 8-nm step—when modeled as an entropic spring, high inter-head forces are predicted when both heads are bound to the microtubule. We addressed this by analyzing the length of the neck linker across different kinesin families and using molecular dynamics simulations to model the extensibility of Kinesin-1 and Kinesin-2 neck linkers. The force–extension profile from molecular dynamics agrees with the worm-like chain (WLC) model for Kinesin-1 and supports the puzzling prediction that extending the neck linker 4 nm requires forces multiple times the motor stall force. Despite being three amino acids longer, simulations suggest that extending the Kinesin-2 neck linker by 4 nm requires similarly high forces. A possible resolution to this dilemma is that helix α-6 may unwind to enable the two-head bound state. Finally, simulations suggest that cis/trans isomerization of a conserved proline residue in Kinesin-2 accounts for the differing predictions of molecular dynamics and the WLC model, and may contribute to motor regulation in vivo.},

	abstract = {We developed molecular models describing the thermally initiated motion of nanocars, nanosized vehicles composed of two to four spherical fullerene wheels chemically coupled to a planar chassis, on a metal surface. The simulations were aimed at reproducing qualitative features of the experimentally observed migration of nanocars over gold crystals as determined by scanning tunneling microscopy. Coarse-grained-type molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for the species “Trimer” and “Nanotruck”, the simplified versions of the experimentally studied nanomachines. Toward this goal, we developed a version of the rigid body molecular dynamics based on the symplectic quaternion scheme in conjunction with the Nose−Poincare thermostat approach. Interactions between rigid fragments were described by using the corrected CHARMM force field parameters, while several empirical models were introduced for interactions of nanocars with gold crystals. With the single adjusted potential parameter, the computed trajectories are consistent with the qualitative features of the thermally activated migration of the nanocars: the primary pivoting motion of Trimer and the two-dimensional combination of translations and pivoting of Nanotruck. This work presents a first attempt at a theoretical analysis of nanocarsʼ dynamics on a surface by providing a computationally minimalist approach.},

Of particular interest is the extended α-helical coiled-coil portion of the molecule. Since there is no high resolution structure for the entire coiled-coil, a study is made of the scallop myosin II S2 subdomain for which an x-ray structure is available (Protein Data Bank 1nkn). We estimate the stretching and bending moduli of the S2 subdomain with an atomic level model by use of molecular simulations. Results were obtained from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of an external force, from the fluctuations in equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and from normal modes. In addition, a poly-Ala (78 amino acid residues) α-helix model was examined to test the methodology and because of its interest as part of the lever arm. As expected, both the α-helix and coiled-coil S2 subdomain are very stiff for stretching along the main axis, with the stretching stiffness constant in the range 60–80 pN/nm (scaled to the 60 nm long S2). Both molecules are much more flexible for bending with a lateral stiffness of ∼0.010pN/nm for the S2 and 0.0055pN/nm for the α-helix (scaled to 60 nm). These results are expected to be useful in estimating cross-bridge elasticity, which is required for understanding the strain-dependent transitions in the actomyosin cycle and for the development of three-dimensional models of muscle contraction.},

It has been found that the diffraction methods are performing very well in the determination of Ca2+-O distances: the obtained values fell in the range 2.43-2.46 Å. Further on, by applying the X-ray diffraction method ion pairs could be observed in the case of higher concentrated solution, but for neutron diffraction study, the most adequate isotope substitution method has to be chosen with care in order to be able to describe ion pairs in solution. The results of diffraction studies were compared to molecular dynamics simulation results; the latter ones were found to be in general accordance with the experimental findings. The smaller discrepancies between the simulation and the experimental results are coming from small differences in the ion-water and ion-ion distances, and they may be due to the potential model applied in the simulation and to the experimental uncertainties.},

This method is applied to a comparative dynamical analysis of the nucleotide-binding pocket of two motor proteins—myosins and kinesins. In myosins, the observed structural changes in the nucleotide-pocket from the transition state to the rigorlike state are dominated by the lowest normal mode that involves significant movements in both switch I and switch II; in kinesins, the measured conformational changes in the nucleotide-pocket are also dominated by the lowest mode, which, however, only involves large movement in switch I. We then compute the global structural changes induced by the nucleotide-pocket deformations as described by the dominant pocket-mode, which yield encouraging results: in myosins, multiple hinge motions involving the opening/closing of the cleft between the upper and lower 50 -kDa subdomains and the swinging movement of the converter are induced, which are dominated by precisely the same global mode that has been recently identified by us as important to the dynamical correlations among the nucleotide-pocket, the actin-binding site, and the converter; in kinesins, the induced global conformational changes are well described by a highly collective global mode which hints for a dynamical pathway spanning from the nucleotide-pocket to the neck-linker via the H6 helix.},

	abstract = {To elucidate the detailed mechanism of ATP hydrolysis in myosin, molecular dynamics employing classical force field and reaction path analyses employing a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) potential were carried out. Although the QM/MM reaction path analyses have limited accuracy due to the lack of extensive conformational sampling, the present work showed that sensible energetics much closer to experimental measurements than previous computational studies can be obtained once the protein environment is included. In the two associative mechanisms studied here, the pathway that involves the conserved residue, Ser 236, as the proton relay group was found to have a lower rate-limiting barrier. However, it was also shown that if O2γ gets protonated, the mechanism without invoking any proton relay has only a slightly higher barrier and therefore may also contribute, especially in mutants such as Ser 236A. By performing calculations for two different motor domain conformations, it was shown that the mechanochemical coupling in myosin is mainly regulated by several residues in the switch I and switch II regions, such as Arg 238, Gly 457, and Glu 459. In particular, when the salt bridge between Arg 238 and Glu 459 is broken as in the prehydrolysis conformation of the motor domain, ATP hydrolysis is highly unfavorable energetically. In this conformation, Arg 238 is closer to ATP and therefore stabilizes the ATP state over the hydrolysis products. Moreover, without the salt bridge, the water structure in the active site is no longer stabilized to favor the in-line nucleophilic attack of the γ-phosphate. The results from the current work have general implications to other molecular motors that involve ATP hydrolysis, such as kinesin, F1−ATPase and Ca2+−ATPase, although more robust conclusions concerning the hydrolysis mechanism require more elaborate simulations that consider protein fluctuations and other possible protonation states of ATP and the hydrolysis products.},

	abstract = {On October 5, 1981, Fortune magazine published a cover article entitled the “Next Industrial Revolution: Designing Drugs by Computer at Merck”. With a 40+ year investment, we have been in the drug design business longer than most. During its history, the Merck drug design group has had several names, but it has always been in the “design” business, with the ultimate goal to provide an actionable hypothesis that could be tested experimentally. Often the result was a small molecule but it could just as easily be a peptide, biologic, predictive model, reaction, process, etc. To this end, the concept of design is now front and center in all aspects of discovery, safety assessment and early clinical development. At present, the Merck design group includes computational chemistry, protein structure determination, and cheminformatics. By bringing these groups together under one umbrella, we were able to align activities and capabilities across multiple research sites and departments. This alignment from 2010 to 2016 resulted in an 80\% expansion in the size of the department, reflecting the increase in impact due to a significant emphasis across the organization to “design first” along the entire drug discovery path from lead identification (LID) to first in human (FIH) dosing. One of the major advantages of this alignment has been the ability to access all of the data and create an adaptive approach to the overall LID to FIH pathway for any modality, significantly increasing the quality of candidates and their probability of success. In this perspective, we will discuss how we crafted a new strategy, defined the appropriate phenotype for group members, developed the right skillsets, and identified metrics for success in order to drive continuous improvement. We will not focus on the tactical implementation, only giving specific examples as appropriate.},

Undershoots of the rate of oxidative phosphorylation would be predicted if the rate of oxidative phosphorylation would depend solely on free [ADP], [Pi], or ΔG ATP. However, undershoots of the rate of oxidative phosphorylation have not been reported in the literature. Furthermore, undershoots of the rate of oxidative phosphorylation are unlikely because there is evidence that a balance between ATP production and consumption cannot be achieved if an undershoot of the rate of oxidative phosphorylation actually occurs. Therefore, oxidative phosphorylation seems to depend not only on free [ADP], [Pi], or ΔG ATP. An explanation is that acidosis-related or other factors control oxidative phosphorylation additionally, at least under some conditions.},

The ab initio calculations show that the phosphoric acid is a good solvent to promote the proton ionization of the sulfonic acid group, and only two phosphoric acid molecules are necessary for the dissociation of one sulfonic acid group. A mechanism of proton hopping between phosphoric acid and protonated phosphoric acid cation in the hydrophilic subphase is also elucidated by ab initio calculations. The molecular dynamics simulations, conducted at a phosphoric acid concentration of 25.4\% (wt) which is slightly lower than that of phosphoric acid swollen Nafion, show that the phosphoric acid exists in subphases and that it cannot develop into a continuous subphase. Thus, proton-hopping pathways are interrupted, and the conductivity is expected to be lower than that for pure phosphoric acid. The molecular dynamics simulations, conducted at a phosphoric acid concentration of 45.1\% (wt) which corresponds to an unstable state, show that the hydrophobic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) backbones trend to gather together forming hydrophobic clusters and that the phosphoric acid forms a continuous subphase with the sulfonic acid groups located at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface. Thus, proton-hopping pathways can develop uninterruptedly like the pure phosphoric acid, and high conductivity is expected. The molecular dynamics study also shows that the hydrogen-bonding characteristics of phosphoric acid and sulfonate anion are similar regardless of the factor that the former can move freely while the latter is attached to Nafion backbone.},

The other two models do not reproduce the native network of hydrogen bonds, suggesting the presence of biases in their conformational and nonbonded interaction properties. The CHARMM model is further validated in the biologically relevant liquid crystal phase by comparing experimental small-angle X-ray scattering spectra from DMPG unilamellar vesicles with data calculated from fluid bilayer simulations. The good agreement found in this model-free comparison implies that liquid crystal PG bilayers as described by CHARMM exhibit realistic bilayer thickness and lateral packing. Last, this model is used to simulate a fluid bilayer of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG). The resulting view of the POPG bilayer structure is at variance with that proposed previously based on simulations, in particular, with respect to lateral packing of head groups and the role of counterions.},

Molecular dynamics simulations of DPPC monolayers using both coarse-grained (CG) and atomistic models yield results that are in rough agreement with some of the experimental isotherms, but with a steeper slope in the liquid-condensed region than seen experimentally and shifted to larger areas. The CG lipid model gives predictions that are very close to those of atomistic simulations, while greatly improving computational efficiency. There is much more variation among experimental isotherms than between isotherms obtained from CG simulations and from the most refined simulation available. Both atomistic and CG simulations yield liquid-condensed and liquid-expanded phase area compressibility moduli that are significantly larger than those typically measured experimentally, but compare well with some experimental values obtained under rapid compression.},

Washing with pH 5 buffer was used to examine the role of amorphous calcium phosphate in CPLX nucleational activity, which was assessed by incubation in synthetic cartilage lymph with varied pH values. Addition of 4 Ca/PS was minimally required to form viable complexes. During the critical first 10-min reaction period, rapid reduction in particle size signaled changes in PS-CPLX structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed increasing mineral phosphate that became progressively deprotonated to . This Ca-mediated effect was mimicked in part by increasing the Ca/PS reaction ratio. Molecular dynamic simulations provided key insight into initial interactions between Ca and P and the carboxyl, amino, and phosphodiester groups of PS. Deduced interatomic distances agreed closely with previous radial distribution function x-ray-absorption fine structure measurements, except for an elongated Ca–N distance, suggesting additional changes in atomic structure during the critical 10-min ripening period. These findings clarify the process of PS-CPLX formation, reveal details of its structure, and provide insight into its role as a nucleator of crystalline calcium phosphate mineral formation.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the relationship between the coordinating residues of the EF-hand calcium binding loop of parvalbumin and the overall plasticity and flexibility of the protein. The first simulation modeled the transition from Ca2+ to Mg2+ coordination by varying the van der Waals parameters for the bound metal ions. The glutamate at position 12 could be accurately and reversibly seen to be a source of selective bidentate ligation of Ca2+ in the simulations. A second simulation correlated well with the experimental observation that an E101D substitution at EF loop position 12 results in a dramatically less tightly bound monodentate Ca2+ coordination by aspartate. A final set of simulations investigated Ca2+ binding in the E101D mutant loop in the presence of applied external forces designed to impose bidentate coordination. The results of these simulations illustrate that the aspartate is capable of attaining a suitable orientation for bidentate coordination, thus implying that it is the inherent rigidity of the loop that prevents bidentate coordination in the parvalbumin E101D mutant.},

In this paper, we provide an atomistic description of collapse from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. More specifically, we investigate monolayers of arachidic acids spread on pure water and in an aqueous solution with Ca2+ ions in the subphase. In both cases, it is found that the collapsed systems generally lead to the formation of multilayer structures, which in the system with Ca2+ ions, proceeds by an intermediate regime where the monolayer exhibits significant roughness (of the order of 4 A). If no roughness is present, the system forms collapsed structures into the aqueous solution. The computational cost of atomic MD limits our simulations to relatively small system sizes, fast compression rates, and temporal scales on the order of a nanosecond. We discuss the issues caused by these limitations and present a detailed discussion of how the collapse regime proceeds at long time scales. We conclude with a summary of the implications of our results for further theoretical and experimental studies.},

For DPPC at 52 °C we found an ASA of 126±8 Å2 per lipid molecule, equivalent to twice the projected lateral area. The ASA was dominated by the contribution from the quaternary ammonium ion which accounts for about two thirds of the total value. The remaining ASA is primarily the phosphate moiety (22±1 Å2), and this contribution almost entirely represents the two [`]out-of-chain' oxygen atoms. Interestingly, even the most exposed parts of the PC head-group show average ASAs of less than half of its maximal or [`]fully hydrated' value. The average ASA of a simulated POPE membrane was 96±7 Å2 per lipid. The smaller value than for DPPC reflects much lower ASA of the ammonium ion, which is partially compensated by increased exposure of the ethylene and phosphate moieties. The ASA of the polar moieties of (PO4, NH3 and COO) constitutes 65\% of the total accessible area for POPE, making this interface more polar than that of DPPC. It is suggested that ASA information can be valuable in attempts to rationalize experimental investigations, particularly molecular interpretations of thermodynamic information.},

	abstract = {The sorting of lipids and proteins in cellular trafficking pathways is a process of central importance in maintaining compartmentalization in eukaryotic cells. However, the mechanisms behind these sorting phenomena are currently far from being understood. Among several mechanistic suggestions, membrane curvature has been invoked as a means to segregate lipids and proteins in cellular sorting centers. To assess this hypothesis, we investigate the sorting of lipid analog dye trace components between highly curved tubular membranes and essentially flat membranes of giant unilamellar vesicles. Our experimental findings indicate that intracellular lipid sorting, contrary to frequent assumptions, is unlikely to occur by lipids fitting into membrane regions of appropriate curvature. This observation is explained in the framework of statistical mechanical lattice models that show that entropy, rather than curvature energy, dominates lipid distribution in the absence of strongly preferential lateral intermolecular interactions. Combined with previous findings of curvature induced phase segregation, we conclude that lipid cooperativity is required to enable efficient sorting. In contrast to lipid analog dyes, the peripheral membrane binding protein Cholera toxin subunit B is effectively curvature-sorted. The sorting of Cholera toxin subunit B is rationalized by statistical models. We discuss the implications of our findings for intracellular sorting mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Earlier studies using X-ray diffraction, light scattering, photon correlation spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy, strongly suggest that SNARE-induced membrane fusion in cells proceeds as a result of calcium bridging opposing bilayers. The bridging of phospholipid heads groups in the opposing bilayers by calcium leads to the release of water from hydrated Ca2+ ions as well as the loosely coordinated water at PO-lipid head groups. Local dehydration of phospholipid head groups and the calcium, bridging opposing bilayers, then leads to destabilization of the lipid bilayers and membrane fusion. This hypothesis was tested in the current study by atomistic molecular dynamic simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble using hydrated dimethylphosphate anions (DMP-) and calcium cations. Results from the study demonstrate, formation of DMP-Ca2+ complexes and the consequent removal of water, supporting the hypothesis. Our study further demonstrates that as a result of Ca2+-DMP self-assembly, the distance between anionic oxygens between the two DMP molecules is reduced to 2.92 Å, which is in close agreement with the 2.8 Å SNARE-induced apposition established between opposing bilayers, reported earlier from X-ray diffraction measurements.},

For this, we have considered the negatively charged di-myristoyl-phosphatidyl-glycerol (DMPG) and di-myristoyl-phosphatidyl-serine (DMPS) bilayers as well as a protonated di-myristoyl-phosphatidyl-serine (DMPSH) bilayer. We were particularly interested in calcium ions due to their important role in biological systems. Simulations performed in the presence of calcium ions (DMPG, DMPS) or sodium ions (DMPS) were run for 45-60 ns. Simulation results for DMPG are compared with fluorescence measurements. The average areas per molecule were 47.4 ± 0.5 Å2 (DMPG with calcium), 47.3 ± 0.5 Å2 (DMPS with calcium), 51.3 ± 1.0 Å2 (DMPS with sodium) and 45.3 ± 0.5 Å2 (DMPSH). The structure of the negatively charged lipids is significantly affected by the counterions, where calcium ions have a more pronounced effect than sodium ions. Calcium ions were found to be tightly bound to the anionic groups of the lipid molecules and as such appear to constitute an integral part of the membrane interface on nanoseconds time scales. In contrast to sodium ions, calcium ions are localised in a narrow ({\textasciitilde} 10 Å) band around the phosphate group. The interaction of calcium with the lipid molecules enhances the molecular packing of the PG and PS lipids. This observation is in good agreement with emission spectra of the membrane partitioning probe Laurdan in DMPG multilamellar vesicles that indicate an increase in the ordering of the DMPG bilayer due to the presence of calcium. Our results indicate that calcium ions, which often function as a second messengers in living cells have a pronounced effect on membrane structures, which may have implications during signal transduction events.},

Finally, several simulations of the coarse-grained model on longer length- and time-scale were performed, both within Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations: a periodical sample of lipid molecules ordered in bilayer, a free sheet of such bilayer without periodic boundary conditions, formation of vesicle from a plain membrane, process of self-assembly of lipids randomly dispersed in volume. It was shown that the coarse-grained model, developed exclusively from all-atomic simulation data, reproduces well all the basic features of lipids in water solution.},

An extension of the program permits the accessibility of atoms, or groups of atoms, to solvent or solute molecules of specified size to be quantitatively assessed. As defined in this study, the accessibility is proportional to surface area. The accessibility of all atoms in the twenty common amino acids in model tripeptides of the type Ala-X-Ala are given for defined conformation. The accessibilities are also given for all atoms in ribonuclease-S, lysozyme and myogoblin. Internal cavities are defined and discussed. Various summaries of these data are provided. Forty to fifty per cent of the surface area of each protein is occupied by non-polar atoms. The actual numerical results are sensitive to the values chosen for the van der Waal's radii of the various groups. Since there is uncertainty over the correct values for these radii, the derived numbers should only be used as a qualitative guide at this stage.
The average change in accessibility for the atoms of all three proteins in going from a hypothetical extended chain to the folded conformation of the native protein is about a factor of 3. This number applies to both polar (nitrogen and oxygen) and non-polar (carbon and sulfur) atoms considered separately. The larger non-polar amino acids tend to be more "buried" in the native form of all three proteins. However, for all classes and for residues within a given class the accessibility changes on folding tend to be highly variable.},

	abstract = {The C2 domain is a ubiquitous, conserved protein signaling motif widely found in eukaryotic signaling proteins. Although considerable functional diversity exists, most C2 domains are activated by Ca2+ binding and then dock to a specific cellular membrane. The C2 domains of protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) and cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha), for example, are known to dock to different membrane surfaces during an intracellular Ca2+ signal. Ca2+ activation targets the PKCalpha C2 domain to the plasma membrane and the cPLA2alpha C2 domain to the internal membranes, with no detectable spatial overlap. It is crucial to determine how such targeting specificity is achieved at physiological bulk Ca2+ concentrations that during a typical signaling event rarely exceed 1 muM. For the isolated PKCalpha C2 domain in the presence of physiological Ca2+ levels, the target lipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) are together sufficient to recruit the PKCalpha C2 domain to a lipid mixture mimicking the plasma membrane inner leaflet. For the cPLA2alpha C2 domain, the target lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) appears to be sufficient to drive membrane targeting to an internal membrane mimic at physiological Ca2+ levels, although the results do not rule out a second, unknown target molecule. Stopped-flow kinetic studies provide additional information about the fundamental molecular events that occur during Ca2+-activated membrane docking. In principle, C2 domain-directed intracellular targeting, which requires coincidence detection of multiple signals (Ca2+ and one or more target lipids), can exhibit two different mechanisms: messenger-activated target affinity (MATA) and target-activated messenger affinity (TAMA). The C2 domains studied here both utilize the TAMA mechanism, in which the C2 domain Ca2+ affinity is too low to be activated by physiological Ca2+ signals in most regions of the cell. Only when the C2 domain nears its target membrane, which provides a high local concentration of target lipid, is the effective Ca2+ affinity increased by the coupled binding equilibrium to a level that enables substantial Ca2+ activation and target docking. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of using physiological ligand concentrations in targeting studies because super-physiological concentrations can drive docking interactions even when an important targeting molecule is missing.},
